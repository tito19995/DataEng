368,"Background: Trafficking in women is a widespread human rights violation commonly associated with poor mental health. Yet, to date, no studies have used psychiatric diagnostic assessment to identify common forms of mental distress among survivors returning to their home country.Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted of women aged 18 and over who returned to Moldova between December 2007 and December 2008 registered by the International Organisation for Migration as a survivor of human trafficking. Psychiatric diagnoses in women at a mean of 6 months after return (range 2-12 months) were made by a trained Moldavian psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and compared with diagnoses recorded in the same women within 5 days of return. We described the socio-demographic characteristics of the women in the sample including both pre and post-trafficking information. We then described the distribution of mental health diagnoses recorded during the crisis intervention phase (1-5 days after return) and the re-integration phase (2-12 months after return). We compared diagnoses at the patient level between the two time points by tabulating the diagnoses and carrying out a kappa test of agreement and the Stuart-Maxwell test for marginal homogeneity (an extension of the McNemar test to kxk table).Results: 120/176 (68%) eligible women participated. At 2-12 months after their return, 54% met criteria for at least one psychiatric diagnoses comprising post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) alone (16%); co-morbid PTSD (20%); other anxiety or mood disorder (18%). 85% of women who had been diagnosed in the crisis phase with co-morbid PTSD or with another anxiety or mood disorder sustained a diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder when followed up during rehabilitation.Conclusions: Trafficked women returning to their country of origin are likely to suffer serious psychological distress that may endure well beyond the time they return. Women found to have co-morbid PTSD or other forms of anxiety and depression immediately post-return should be offered evidenced-based mental health treatment for at least the standard 12-month period of rehabilitation.","Ostrovschi, Nicolae V",10.1186/1471-2458-11-232,BMC Public Health,women in post-trafficking services in moldova: diagnostic interviews over two time periods to assess returning womens mental health.,2011

326,"Objective: This study describes the existence and nature of services within state child and adult mental health systems that support the transition from adolescence to adulthood.Methods: State child and adult mental health administrators from all but one state were interviewed by telephone with a semistructured questionnaire regarding transition services in their state mental health system, such as supported housing, vocational support, preparation for independent living, and dual diagnosis treatment. Eight states were deemed sufficiently decentralized to render state-level administrator reports invalid. Specific service data from the remaining 41 states and the District of Columbia were analyzed with descriptive statistics.Results: One-quarter of child state mental health systems and one-half of adult state mental health systems offered no transition services, and few provided any kind of transition service at more than one site. Most types of transition services were available at all in less than 20 percent of the states.Conclusions: Across the United States transition support services are lacking. The adult system in particular will require major transformation to provide the service capacity that is needed to meet the current standards of transition service accessibility for young Americans with serious mental health conditions.",Davis M,NLM17085607,Psychiatric Services,within-state availability of transition-to-adulthood services for youths with serious mental health conditions.,Nov2006

257,"Objective: One of the original principles of assertive community treatment (ACT) is that treatment should be time unlimited. Although termination is not uncommon in ACT, it has not been empirically studied. This study examined termination from a large program based on ACT.Methods: This study used national data from the Department of Veterans Affairs Mental Health Intensive Case Management program modeled on ACT to compare veteran characteristics, patterns of service delivery, and early clinical changes among veterans who terminated early (less than one year) and later (one to three years) with those of veterans had not terminated after three years. Bivariate comparisons and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with early and later termination.Results: Among 1,402 veterans enrolled in fiscal years (FY) 2002-2004, 16% terminated early, 26% terminated later, and 57% had not terminated after three years. Compared with those who had not terminated, those who terminated early showed higher suicidality scores, and participants who terminated early and those who terminated later were less likely to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia and were more likely to have lower quality of life at entry. Stronger differentiating effects were observed for program participation. Those who terminated received less intensive services during the first six months of participation and had a weaker therapeutic alliance. Although participants who terminated early showed more violent behavior at follow-up than the other two groups, there were no other differences in early clinical changes.Conclusions: Rates of both early and later termination were substantial, and less active participation was a stronger predictor of termination than either patient characteristics or clinical changes. A diagnosis of schizophrenia was associated with continued treatment. Further research is needed to determine the impact of termination on longer-term outcomes.",Mohamed S,10.1176/ps.2010.61.7.675,Psychiatric Services,who terminates from act and why? data from the national va mental health intensive case management program.,Jul2010

Several diagnostic, social, and historical variables distinguished the groups.Conclusions: Given the substantial overlap among the three forms of violence, clinicians should routinely screen patients who report one form for the occurrence of the other two. Co-occurrence of several forms of violence may require a package of interventions with components geared to each.","Monahan, John",10.1176/appi.ps.201600135,Psychiatric Services,"violence to others, violent self-victimization, and violent victimization by others among persons with a mental illness.",May2017
297,"OBJECTIVE: This article explores the link between violence and the practice of legally mandating treatment in the community or leveraging benefits from the social welfare system, such as subsidized housing and disability income support, to ensure adherence to treatment. METHOD: Data are presented from a survey of 1,011 persons with psychiatric disorders receiving treatment in public mental health service systems in five U.S. cities. Multinomial logit analysis was used to examine the association between physically assaultive behavior and experience of social welfare leverage, legal leverage, or both types of leverage, with the analyses controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Across study sites, 18% to 21% of participants reported having committed violent acts in the past 6 months; 3% to 9% reported having used or made threats with a lethal weapon, committed sexual assault, or caused injury. About three-quarters of subjects who reported such serious violence also reported having experienced some form of leveraged treatment, compared with about one-half of subjects who did not report serious violence. Demographic and clinical factors that were independently associated with the likelihood of experiencing both types of leverage included younger age, male gender, poorer clinical functioning, more years in treatment, more frequent hospitalizations, higher frequency of outpatient visits, and negative attitudes toward medication adherence. Among participants who did not voluntarily take psychotropic medication, even minor assaultiveness was associated with having experienced legal leverage. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of concerns about safety and treatment nonadherence may influence decisions by clinicians and judges to apply legal leverage.",Swanson JW,NLM16877654,American Journal of Psychiatry,violence and leveraged community treatment for persons with mental disorders.,Aug2006

In recent decades the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has developed a national network of ACT-like programs called mental health intensive case management (MHICM), which have served veterans from diverse locations across the country, including urban and rural areas.Methods: This study used rural-urban commuting area codes and national VA administrative data to compare characteristics of veterans and patterns of MHICM service delivery among veterans with mental illness living in large urban, large rural, small rural, and isolated rural communities.Results: Among veterans enrolled in MHICM from FY 2000 to FY 2005 (N=5,221), 84% (N=4,373) resided in urban areas, 8% (N=421) in large cities, 6% (N=291) in small rural towns, and 3% (N=136) in isolated rural areas. MHICM participants who lived in rural areas had clinical problems broadly similar to those in urban areas, although more rural veterans were unemployed, disabled, received VA disability compensation, and had a payee or fiduciary. MHICM clients in smaller or isolated rural areas received slightly less frequent and less intensive contacts and less recovery-oriented services than those in large urban locations.Conclusions: These data highlight the need for intensive case management services in rural areas and note some challenges in providing them at the intensity and frequency observed in urban areas where travel distances and times are shorter.",Mohamed S,10.1176/appi.ps.60.7.914,Psychiatric Services,va intensive mental health case management in urban and rural areas: veteran characteristics and service delivery.,Jul2009

Few studies, however, have addressed this issue, let alone the implementation of guidelines for common mental health disorders. The aim of this study is to compile and describe implementation strategies and resources related to common clinical mental health disorders targeted at service users.Methods: The literature was reviewed and resources for the implementation of clinical guidelines were compiled using the PRISMA model. A mixed qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed based on a series of categories developed ad hoc.Results: A total of 263 items were included in the preliminary analysis and 64 implementation resources aimed at users were analysed in depth. A wide variety of types, sources and formats were identified, including guides (40%), websites (29%), videos and leaflets, as well as instruments for the implementation of strategies regarding information and education (64%), self-care, or users assessment of service quality.Conclusions: The results reveal the need to establish clear criteria for assessing the quality of implementation materials in general and standardising systems to classify user-targeted strategies. The compilation and description of key elements of strategies and resources for users can be of interest in designing materials and specific actions for this target audience, as well as improving the implementation of clinical guidelines.","Moreno, Eliana M.",10.1186/s12961-016-0135-y,Health Research Policy & Systems,user involvement in the implementation of clinical guidelines for common mental health disorders: a review and compilation of strategies and resources.,8/9/2016

Health care use was abstracted from Veterans Affairs databases (March 1998 to June 2000) for one year after hospital discharge. Lifetime intravenous drug use was related to increased use of outpatient services, and current alcohol use was related to decreased health care use. Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder had greater use of medical outpatient services than patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, although they had longer hospital stays.

254,"Objective: This study described use of services for a major depressive episode and determined factors associated with use in Spain, a country with universal access to care and a relatively low prevalence of depression.Methods: Data were from the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD). ESEMeD-Spain was a cross-sectional, general population survey conducted with a representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults (N=5,473). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used, and 12-month use of services for a major depressive episode, types of services used, and receipt of minimally adequate treatment were assessed.Results: Among the 247 respondents with a major depressive episode in the past 12 months, 59% reported any use of past-year services for their disorder; of this group, 76% reported receipt of any active treatment (from a health care or mental health professional). Among respondents with severe depression, 31% used no services. A higher likelihood of service use was found among those who were unemployed or too disabled to work (OR=4.9, CI=1.3-19), who had moderate depression symptoms (OR=3.2, CI=1.1-9.0), and who had one mental disorder comorbid with depression (OR=2.9, CI=1.2-7.0) or two or more such comorbid disorders (OR=4.1, CI=1.9-8.9). In the active treatment group, only 31.2% received treatment that was minimally adequate.Conclusions: There is a need in Spain to increase use of services for a major depressive episode, especially among certain population groups, such as women, and to improve adequacy of treatments. The role of specific factors, such as availability of services and of professionals, deserves further research.",Gabilondo A,10.1176/ps.62.2.pss6202_0152,Psychiatric Services,use of primary and specialized mental health care for a major depressive episode in spain by esemed respondents.,Feb2011

178,"OBJECTIVE This study explored the range of interventions and the use of more intrusive techniques by staff of assertive community treatment (ACT) teams to promote engagement, manage problem behaviors, and reinforce positive behaviors among patients. Individual and organizational characteristics that may be associated with these practices were identified. METHODS Between January and March 2006, clinicians (N=239) from 34 ACT teams participated in a one-time survey about their intervention strategies with patients, perceptions about the ACT team environment, and beliefs about persons with severe mental illness. RESULTS Significant variation existed in the types of interventions employed across teams. The less intrusive strategies, including positive inducements and verbal guidance, were the most common. Other strategies that placed limits on patients but that were still considered less intrusive-such as medication monitoring and money management-were also common. Clinicians who reported working in more demoralized climates and having negative perceptions of mental illness were more likely to endorse leveraged or intrusive interventions. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study suggest significant variation across teams in the use of intervention strategies. Both perceptions of a demoralized organizational climate and stigmatizing beliefs about mental illness were correlated with the use of more intrusive intervention strategies. Future research on the role and appropriateness of more intrusive interventions in mental health treatment and the impact of such interventions on patient outcomes is warranted.","Manuel, Jennifer I",10.1176/appi.ps.201200151,Psychiatric Services,use of intervention strategies by assertive community treatment teams to promote patients engagement.,Jun2013

The primary diagnoses were schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (53%), bipolar disorder (24%), and major depression (23%), and all participants had a current or past substance use disorder. A majority had a history of trauma, including sexual trauma, physical assault, the loss of a family member, or having witnessed someone being killed or seriously injured.Results: Clients were asked about past sexual or physical assault history by a median of zero providers, and 59% said a history of assault was not addressed during treatment. Severity of posttraumatic stress disorder and the range of traumas experienced by the client were not predictors of the degree to which trauma and its consequences were a part of treatment. Clients desire to discuss trauma during treatment and feeling upset while discussing trauma were both predictors of whether trauma was a focus of treatment.Conclusions: Clinicians may not adequately address trauma during treatment of severe mental illness.

146,"Objective: This study examined how two key process-of-care tasks of the collaborative care model (CCM) predict patient depression outcomes.Methods: Registry data were from a large implementation of the CCM in Washington State and included 5,439 patient-episodes for patients age 18 or older with a baseline Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score of ?10 and at least one follow-up contact with the CCM care manager within 24 weeks of initial contact. Key CCM tasks examined were at least one care manager follow-up contact within four weeks of initial contact and at least one psychiatric consultation between weeks 8 and 12 for patients not responding to treatment by week 8. Clinically significant improvement in depression symptoms was defined as achieving a PHQ-9 score of <10 or a 50% or more reduction in PHQ-9 score compared with baseline. Bivariate and multivariate (logistic and proportional hazard models) analyses were conducted to examine how fidelity with either task predicted outcomes. All analyses were conducted with the original sample and with a propensity score-matched sample.Results: Four-week follow-up was associated with a greater likelihood of achieving improvement in depression (odds ratio OR=1.63, 95% confidence interval CI=1.23-2.17) and a shorter time to improvement (hazard ratio=2.06, CI=1.67-2.54). Psychiatric consultation was also associated with a greater likelihood of improvement (OR=1.44, CI=1.13-1.84) but not with a shorter time to improvement. Propensity score-matched analysis yielded very similar results.Conclusions: Findings support efforts to improve fidelity to the two process-of-care tasks and to include these tasks among quality measures for CCM implementation.",Yuhua Bao,10.1176/appi.ps.201400577,Psychiatric Services,unpacking collaborative care for depression: examining two essential tasks for implementation.,Apr2016

In both groups, older age was associated with a lower likelihood of reporting unmet need for treatment, whereas greater distress and impairment and higher education were associated with a greater likelihood of reporting unmet need. Among treatment seekers, treatment from general medical providers was associated with greater likelihood of unmet need, and more outpatient visits and insurance coverage for the full year were associated with a lower likelihood of unmet need. The most common reason for not seeking needed treatment was a concern about costs (cited as a reason by 46.0% of the total sample).Conclusions: Even though rates of treatment seeking have increased, many persons with major depression continue to experience unmet need for treatment, which in this study was mainly attributable to concerns about treatment costs.",Mojtabai R,10.1176/appi.ps.60.3.297,Psychiatric Services,unmet need for treatment of major depression in the united states.,Mar2009

Among those who recognised their need for treatment, most (71.1%) made at least one visit to a service provider. Among those who received treatment, only 41.0% received treatment that met minimal standards. This resulted in only 16.5% of all individuals with 12-month MDD receiving minimally adequate treatment.Conclusions: Only a minority of participants with MDD received minimally adequate treatment: 1 in 5 people in high-income and 1 in 27 in low-/lower-middle-income countries.

The analysis compared sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, mental health service use, and perceived barriers to mental health care among female veterans who do and do not use the VA as their main source of health care and male veterans who mainly use VA health care.Results: By gender, 23.4% of female veterans and 19.6% of male veterans identified the VA as their main source of health care, which was not significantly different. Compared with male VA patients, women were more likely to be single, younger, and from a racial-ethnic minority group and to screen positive for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but they were less likely to have a substance use disorder. Compared with female veterans who did not mainly use VA care, female VA patients were more likely to be on a low income, not employed, from racial-ethnic minority groups, and combat veterans, and they were more likely to have a disability, to screen positive for PTSD, and to report poorer mental health-related functioning. There were no group differences in mental health service use, and the most frequently endorsed barriers to using mental health care across veteran groups were ""high treatment costs"" and ""being seen as weak.""Conclusions: These findings highlight the health care needs of female VA service users and support efforts to dispel misconceptions and stigma related to mental health care.","Tsai, Jack",10.1176/appi.ps.201400550,Psychiatric Services,u.s. female veterans who do and do not rely on va health care: needs and barriers to mental health treatment.,Nov2015

265,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined characteristics associated with the use of seclusion and restraint among 442 psychiatrically hospitalized youths and sought to quantify changing trends in the rates of these modalities of treatment over time after the 1999 implementation of federal regulations and an institutional performance improvement program. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data related to all 5,929 incidents of seclusion and restraint that occurred during 2000 and 2001 at a child and adolescent state psychiatric hospital were analyzed. RESULTS: The two-year prevalence of use of seclusion was 61 percent and of restraint was 49 percent. Children and adolescents who were admitted on an emergency basis and those belonging to ethnic minority groups were more likely to undergo seclusion or restraint. Children aged 11 years and younger were more likely to undergo seclusion. The total number of episodes decreased by 26 percent and their cumulative duration decreased by 38 percent between the first quarter of 2000 and the last quarter of 2001. The decreases were the result of fewer seclusion and restraint incidents as well as shorter episodes of restraint. Over time, a concurrent increase was observed in the proportion of episodes associated with patient (but not staff) injuries and with as-needed use of medications. CONCLUSIONS: National reforms and institutional efforts can lead to downward trends in the use of seclusion and restraint among psychiatrically hospitalized youths. The active elements of these interventions warrant further study and replication.",Donovan A,NLM12851435,Psychiatric Services,two-year trends in the use of seclusion and restraint among psychiatrically hospitalized youths.,Jul2003

METHOD: Rorschach protocols for 90 seriously disturbed, treatment-resistant patients, 42 of whom were primarily preoccupied with primitive issues of interpersonal relatedness and used avoidant defenses (anaclitic patients) and 48 primarily preoccupied with primitive issues of self-definition and self-worth and used counteractive defenses (introjective patients), were evaluated at the beginning of treatment and, on average, 15 months into treatment. RESULTS: Change in anaclitic patients occurred primarily in more pathological forms of thought disorder (contaminations and confabulations) that express boundary disturbances; change in introjective patients occurred primarily in the less disturbed thought disorder (fabulized combinations) that expresses tendencies toward referential thinking.

331,"OBJECTIVE: Women with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders frequently have a history of interpersonal violence, and past research has suggested that they are not served effectively by the current service system. The goal of the Women, Co-occurring Disorders, and Violence Study was to develop and test the effectiveness of new service approaches specifically designed for these women. METHODS: A quasi-experimental treatment outcome study was conducted from 2001 to 2003 at nine sites. Although intervention specifics such as treatment length and modality varied across sites, each site used a comprehensive, integrated, trauma-informed, and consumer-involved approach to treatment. Substance use problem severity, mental health symptoms, and trauma symptoms were measured at baseline, and follow-up data were analyzed with prospective meta-analysis and hierarchical linear modeling. RESULTS: A total of 2,026 women had data at the 12-month follow-up: 1,018 in the intervention group and 1,008 in the usual-care group. For substance use outcomes, no effect was found. The meta-analysis demonstrated small but statistically significant overall improvement in womens trauma and mental health symptoms in the intervention relative to the usual-care comparison condition. Analysis of key program elements demonstrated that integrating substance abuse, mental health, and trauma-related issues into counseling yielded greater improvement, whereas the delivery of numerous core services yielded less improvement relative to the comparison group. A few person-level characteristics were associated with increases or decreases in the intervention effect. These neither moderated nor supplanted the effects of integrated counseling. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes for women with co-occurring disorders and a history of violence and trauma may improve with integrated treatment.",Morrissey JP,NLM16215186,Psychiatric Services,twelve-month outcomes of trauma-informed interventions for women with co-occurring disorders.,Oct2005

323,"OBJECTIVE: We examined trends in delivery of mental health and substance abuse services at the nations community health centers. METHODS: Analyses used data from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Bureau of Primary Cares (BPHC) 1998 and 2003 Uniform Data System, merged with county-level data. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2003, the number of patients diagnosed with a mental health/substance abuse disorder in community health centers increased from 210,000 to 800,000. There was an increase in the number of patients per specialty mental health/substance abuse treatment provider and a decline in the mean number of patient visits, from 7.3 visits per patient to 3.5 by 2003. Although most community health centers had some on-site mental health/substance abuse services, centers without on-site services were more likely to be located in counties with fewer mental health/substance abuse clinicians, psychiatric emergency rooms, and inpatient hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Community health centers are playing an increasingly central role in providing mental health/substance abuse treatment services in the United States. It is critical both to ensure that these centers have adequate resources for providing mental health/substance abuse care and that they develop effective linkages with mental health/substance abuse clinicians in the communities they serve.",Druss BG,10.2105/AJPH.2005.076943,American Journal of Public Health,trends in mental health and substance abuse services at the nations community health centers: 1998-2003.,Oct2006

299,"OBJECTIVE: Cross-country comparisons of patterns of mental health treatment seeking provide insights into the impact of contextual factors on mental health service use. This study aimed to compare prevalence and predictors of mental health treatment seeking among adults with major depression in Canada and the United States. METHODS: Data for 751 participants with a probable major depressive episode in the past 12 months were drawn from the 2002-2003 Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health: 304 were from Canada and 447 were from the United States. Probable major depressive episodes were ascertained by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short-Form. Patterns of contacts with mental health and general health providers for mental health reasons were compared. RESULTS: Prevalence of contacts with any provider for mental health problems was similar among participants with a probable major depressive episode in Canada and the United States (181 Canadians, or 56 percent, compared with 245 Americans, or 52 percent). Canadian participants were more likely than those in the United States to seek treatment for mental health problems from family doctors and general practitioners, and among participants who sought such treatment, Canadians were more likely to also seek treatment from mental health professionals. In both countries, racial or ethnic minorities were less likely than Caucasians to seek treatment. Depression severity was more closely associated with treatment seeking in Canada than in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Although studies from the early 1990s showed higher rates of treatment seeking for depression in Canada than in the United States, the more recent data presented here do not show such a gap. However, differences persist in the use of various providers. Compared with the United States, Canada had a closer match between depression severity and treatment, which suggests more efficient allocation of mental health care resources for treatment of depression in Canada.",Mojtabai R,NLM16675755,Psychiatric Services,treatment seeking for depression in canada and the united states.,May2006
258,"Objective: Despite the high prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among veterans treated at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, rates of initiation of mental health treatment and persistence in treatment are unknown. This study examined outpatient treatment participation among veterans with a recent PTSD diagnosis and treatment differences according to the VA sector in which they received the diagnosis (PTSD specialty treatment program, general mental health clinic, and general medical clinic).Methods: Administrative data for 20,284 veterans who had received a diagnosis of PTSD at VA facilities were analyzed to determine rates of treatment initiation (any psychotropic prescription, an antidepressant prescription, behavioral counseling, and either a prescription or counseling) and maintenance of pharmacotherapy (at least four 30-day supplies), and counseling (at least eight visits) for the six months after diagnosis.Results: Approximately two-thirds of the sample initiated treatment: 50% received a psychotropic medication and 39% received some counseling; 64% received either medication or counseling. About half of those given medication (54%) received at least a four-month supply, and 24% of those given counseling had at least eight sessions. Overall, 33% received minimally adequate treatment. Initiation, type, and duration varied by treatment sector: receipt of a diagnosis in a PTSD specialty program or a mental health clinic conferred small but significant benefits over receipt in a general medical clinic.Conclusions: Greater availability of mental health specialty services, particularly PTSD services, may be needed to ensure that veterans receive minimally adequate treatment after a PTSD diagnosis.",Spoont MR,10.1176/appi.ps.61.1.58,Psychiatric Services,"treatment receipt by veterans after a ptsd diagnosis in ptsd, mental health, or general medical clinics.",Jan2010
243,"Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequent consequence of war experience, and specialized centers have been established in some war-affected areas to provide treatment. This study assessed treatment costs and outcomes in such centers in former Yugoslavia.Methods: An observational study was conducted in four specialized treatment centers (in Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina). A total of 526 consecutive adult patients with war-related PTSD were assessed at the beginning of treatment, and 463 met inclusion criteria, including a diagnosis of PTSD on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS). For most patients seven years had elapsed between the traumatic experience and treatment at the specialized center. Service costs were also assessed. Outcomes measured at one year were the presence of a PTSD diagnosis and severity of symptoms as indicated by the CAPS score and subjective quality of life as measured by the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life.Results: At 12 months 380 (82%) patients were followed up, and 325 (86%) met criteria for PTSD. Symptoms and quality of life showed overall small but statistically significant improvements. Treatment costs for patients with and without PTSD at 12 months did not significantly differ (euro 307 and euro 284, respectively).Conclusions: The recovery rate among patients treated in specialized centers for war-related PTSD several years after the war was poor (14%), and symptom improvements were small. The recovery rate was not linked to service costs.

105,"Objective: Many youths receiving community mental health treatment do not receive evidence-based interventions. Research suggests that community mental health therapists use a broad range of therapeutic techniques at low intensities. This study examined the relationship between therapist- and client-level predictors of community-based therapists report of cognitive, behavioral, psychodynamic, and family techniques within the context of implementation efforts.Methods: A total of 130 therapists participated from 23 organizations in an urban, publicly funded behavioral health system implementing evidence-based practices. Therapist-level predictors included age, gender, clinical experience, licensure status, and participation in evidence-based practice initiatives. Child-level predictors included therapist-reported child primary disorder (externalizing, internalizing, or other) and child age. Therapists completed the Therapist Procedures Checklist-Family Revised, a self-report measure of therapeutic techniques used.Results: Unlicensed therapists were more likely than licensed therapists to report using psychodynamic and behavioral techniques. Therapists who did not participate in an evidence-based practice initiative were less likely to report use of cognitive techniques. Those with clients with externalizing disorders were more likely to report use of behavioral and family techniques. Therapists with the youngest clients (ages three to seven years) were most likely to report use of behavioral techniques and less likely to report use of cognitive and psychodynamic techniques.Conclusions: Results suggest that both therapist and client factors predict self-reported use of therapy techniques. Participating in an evidence-based practice initiative was associated with increased reports of using cognitive techniques. Therapists reported using behavioral and family techniques more than other techniques when working with youths with externalizing disorders and using fewer cognitive and psychodynamic techniques with young clients.","Benjamin Wolk, Courtney",10.1176/appi.ps.201500022,Psychiatric Services,therapist- and client-level predictors of use of therapy techniques during implementation in a large public mental health system.,May2016

Services were provided over a 6-year period in an urban, residency-training clinic serving a primarily publicly insured population.Results: Of the 4,440 patients seen by behavioral health clinicians (BHCs), 2,829 (63.7%) were seen during well-child checks to address a wide array of presenting problems. The five consultation types ""Healthy Steps (6%), pregnancy-related depression (17.7%), developmental (19.2%), mental health (53.2%), and psychopharmacology (5%)"" were characterized by differences in demographics, presenting problems, recommendations, and medical diagnoses.Conclusions: Pediatric BHCs provide a wide range of services to pediatric populations in the context of integrated behavioral health programs.

237,"OBJECTIVE: This study sought to identify health conditions for which a primary care psychiatrist would be an appropriate treatment provider in an integrated model of health care delivery for persons with serious mental illness. A primary care psychiatrist is a psychiatrist with primary care training who is supervised by an on-site internist. METHODS: Rating methods for health conditions were adapted from those jointly developed by Rand and the University of California, Los Angeles. A consensus panel of 14 hospital administrators, internists, psychiatrists, and nursing service representatives from three southern California Veterans Affairs health care systems was convened. Eleven physician-panelists, including five psychiatrist, five internists, and a medical specialist, rated whether a general psychiatrist, a primary care psychiatrist, an internist, or a medical specialist could reasonably provide evaluation, treatment, or preventive care for uncomplicated instances of each of 344 physical health conditions or procedures. RESULTS: A primary care psychiatrist, with supervision by an internist, was rated as an appropriate treatment provider for most of the 344 conditions. The conditions included many of those cited by patients as the most common reasons for ambulatory care visits. Panelists identified some intrusive elements of primary care, such as a pelvic examination, as potentially injurious to the psychiatrist-patient relationship and inappropriate for performance by psychiatrists. CONCLUSIONS: This study took the first essential step in evaluating the integration of primary care into the psychiatric setting. Further research is needed to determine whether use of primary care psychiatrists will increase access to primary care by persons with serious mental illness and improve outcomes.",Golomb BA,NLM10828108,Psychiatric Services,the role of psychiatrists in primary care of patients with severe mental illness.,Jun2000

This article provides a cost-effectiveness analysis of assertive community treatment and usual care from community mental health teams (CMHTs) in the United Kingdom.Methods: Participants who had difficulties engaging with community services were randomly assigned to ACT (N=127) or continued usual care from CMHTs (N= 124). Costs were measured at baseline and 18 months later and compared between the two groups. In the analysis, cost data were linked to information on satisfaction, which had been shown to be significantly higher with ACT.Results: Total follow-up costs over 18 months were higher for the ACT group by pounds sterling 4,031 ($6,369), but this was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval of - pounds sterling 2,592 to pounds sterling 10,690 -$4,095 to $16,890). A one-unit improvement in satisfaction was associated with extra costs in the ACT group of pounds sterling 473 ($747).Conclusions: The costs of ACT were not significantly different from usual care. ACT did, however, result in greater levels of client satisfaction and engagement with services and as such may be the preferred community treatment option for patients with long-term serious mental health problems.",McCrone P,10.1176/appi.ps.60.7.908,Psychiatric Services,the react study: cost-effectiveness analysis of assertive community treatment in north london.,Jul2009

136,"Objective: To state the sociodemographic characteristics, mental health histories, index offence characteristics, and criminal histories of male and female forensic psychiatric patients. Clinicians and researchers advocate that mental health and criminal justice organizations implement gender-specific services; however, few studies have sampled forensic patients to evaluate the extent to which mens and womens treatment and management needs are different. Method: Data were collected from Review Board files from May 2000 to April 2005 in the 3 largest Canadian provinces. Using official criminal records, participants were followed for 3 to 8 years, until December 2008. The final sample comprised 1800 individuals: 15.6% were women and 84.4% were men. Results: There were few demographic differences, but women had higher psychosocial functioning than men. Both men and women had extensive mental health histories; women were more likely diagnosed with mood disorders and PDs and men were more likely diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and SUDs. The nature of the index offence did not differ by gender, except women were more likely to have perpetrated murders and attempted murders. For offences against a person, women were more likely to offend against offspring and partners and less likely to offend against strangers, compared with men. Women had significantly less extensive criminal histories than men. Conclusions: Not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder-accused women have a distinct psychosocial, clinical, and criminological profile from their male counterparts, which may suggest gender-specific assessment, risk management, and treatment in forensic services could benefit patients. The findings are also consistent with traditional models (Risk-Need-Responsivity) and ultimately demonstrate the importance of individual assessment and client-centred services.","Nicholls, Tonia L",NLM25886689,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,the national trajectory project of individuals found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder. part 5: how essential are gender-specific forensic psychiatric services?,Mar2015

Although the Criminal Code is federally legislated, criminal justice is administered by provinces and territories. It follows that a person with mental illness who comes into conflict with the law and subsequently comes under the management of a legally mandated RB may experience different trajectories across jurisdictions. Method: The National Trajectory Project examined 1800 men and women found NCRMD in British Columbia (n = 222), Quebec (n = 1094), and Ontario (n = 484) between May 2000 and April 2005, followed until December 2008. Results: We found significant interprovincial differences in the trajectories of people found NCRMD, including time detained in hospital and time under the supervision of an RB. The odds of being conditionally or absolutely discharged by the RB varied across provinces, even after number of past offences, diagnosis at verdict, and most severe index offence (all covariates decreased likelihood of discharge) were considered. Conclusions: Considerable discrepancies in the application of NCRMD legislation and the processing of NCRMD cases through the forensic system across the provinces suggests that fair and equitable treatment under the law could be enhanced by increased national integration and collaboration.","Crocker, Anne G",NLM25886687,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,the national trajectory project of individuals found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder in canada. part 3: trajectories and outcomes through the forensic system.,Mar2015

141,"Objective: Stakeholders have expressed concern over the appropriate use of psychiatric medications and adequacy of mental health services for youths involved with the juvenile justice system. This study assessed the impact of implementing psychiatric practice guidelines on medication costs and youth aggression in a juvenile justice facility. The study examined whether implementing psychiatric practice guidelines in a facility with an organized psychosocial treatment program would reduce psychiatric medication costs, compared with two other facilities, and whether lower psychotropic medication costs would be associated with increases in youth aggression.Methods: Administrative data from three state-run juvenile justice facilities were analyzed to determine psychiatric medication costs and rates of youth aggression. Psychiatric practice guidelines that involved screening, shared decision making, psychosocial treatments, medication prescribing, and monitoring of side effects were implemented in only one of the three facilities, with a goal of applying evidence-based psychopharmacology and benefit-risk considerations.Results: Over the ten-year study period (2003-2012), psychiatric medication costs decreased 26% at the facility implementing the psychiatric practice guidelines, whereas costs at the two comparison facilities increased by 104% and 152%. As psychiatric medication costs decreased at the facility implementing the guidelines, youth aggression there did not increase.Conclusions: Implementing psychiatric practice guidelines in juvenile justice facilities can reduce psychotropic medication costs without an increase in youth aggression. Implementation of the guidelines requires an organized psychosocial treatment program to help deter an inappropriate focus on psychotropic treatments.","Lee, Terry G.",10.1176/appi.ps.201400544,Psychiatric Services,the impact of psychiatric practice guidelines on medication costs and youth aggression in a juvenile justice residential treatment program.,Feb2016

133,"Objective: A core component of mental health courts (MHCs) is the provision of community treatment in order to reduce arrests. However, research on the components of treatment received by MHC participants is rare. This study examined the impact of community treatment on arrests in an MHC sample (N=357) and a sample from the traditional criminal justice system (N=384).Methods: Data were from the MacArthur MHC Project, which includes objective and subjective information from four MHCs with comparison samples at each site. Interview data were collected for six months before and six months after entry into the MHC or legal system. National data from arrest records over one year were also obtained. Treatment-related variables were compliance (appointments and medication), perceptions (motivation and perceived voluntariness), and use of nine types of community treatment. A fixed-effects regression controlled for selection bias between groups.Results: The regression model indicated significant increases in treatment motivation and use of community mental health and substance abuse services among MHC participants, compared with treatment-as-usual participants; however, the perceived voluntariness of treatment decreased in the MHC group. For the treatment-as-usual group, none of the treatment variables were associated with future arrest. For the MHC group, increased medication compliance and use of mental health services were associated with a significant decrease in arrests.Conclusions: Consistent with the MHC goals, findings indicated increases in receipt of community treatment among MHC participants. For the MHC sample, but not the treatment-as-usual sample, increased treatment was associated with reduced recidivism.","Han, Woojae",10.1176/appi.ps.201500006,Psychiatric Services,the impact of community treatment on recidivism among mental health court participants.,Apr2016

270,"Background: Patient and public involvement in research (PPIR) may improve trial recruitment rates, but it is unclear how. Where trials use PPIR to improve design and conduct, many do not communicate this clearly to potential participants. Better communication of PPIR might encourage patient enrolment, as trials may be perceived as more socially valid, relevant and trustworthy. We aimed to evaluate the impact on recruitment of directly advertising PPIR to potential trial participants.Methods: This is a cluster trial, embedded within a host trial (EQUIP) recruiting service users diagnosed with severe mental illness. The intervention was informed by a systematic review, a qualitative study, social comparison theory and a stakeholder workshop including service users and carers. Adopting Participatory Design approaches, we co-designed the recruitment intervention with PPIR partners using a leaflet to advertise the PPIR in EQUIP and sent potential participants invitations with the leaflet (intervention group) or not (control group). Primary outcome was the proportion of patients enrolled in EQUIP. Secondary outcomes included the proportions of patients who positively responded to the trial invitation.Results: Thirty-four community mental health teams were randomised and 8182 service users invited. For the primary outcome, 4% of patients in the PPIR group were enrolled versus 5.3% of the control group. The intervention was not effective for improving recruitment rates (adjusted OR?=?0.75, 95% CI?=?0.53 to 1.07, p?=?0.113). For the secondary outcome of positive response, the intervention was not effective, with 7.3% of potential participants in the intervention group responding positively versus 7.9% of the control group (adjusted OR?=?0.74, 95% CI?=?0.53 to 1.04, p?=?0.082). We did not find a positive impact of directly advertising PPIR on any other outcomes.Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest ever embedded trial to evaluate a recruitment or PPIR intervention. Advertising PPIR did not improve enrolment rates or any other outcome. It is possible that rather than advertising PPIR being the means to improve recruitment, PPIR may have an alternative impact on trials by making them more attractive, acceptable and patient-centred.

197,"Background: A self-reported life satisfaction question is routinely used as an indicator of societal well-being. Several studies support that mental illness is an important determinant for life satisfaction and improvement of mental healthcare access therefore could have beneficial effects on a populations life satisfaction. However, only a few studies report the relationship between subjective mental health and life satisfaction. Subjective mental health is a broader concept than the presence or absence of psychopathology. In this study, we examine the strength of the association between a self-reported mental health question and self-reported life satisfaction, taking into account other relevant factors.Methods: We conducted this analysis using successive waves of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) collected between 2003 and 2012. Respondents included more than 400,000 participants aged 12 and over. We extracted information on self-reported mental health, socio-demographic and other factors and examined correlation with self-reported life satisfaction using a proportional ordered logistic regression.Results: Life satisfaction was strongly associated with self-reported mental health, even after simultaneously considering factors such as income, general health, and gender. The poor-self-reported mental health group had a particularly low life satisfaction. In the fair-self-reported mental health category, the odds of having a higher life satisfaction were 2.35 (95% CI 2.21 to 2.50) times higher than the odds in the poor category. In contrast, for the ""between 60,000 CAD and 79,999 CAD"" household income category, the odds of having a higher life satisfaction were only 1.96 (95% CI 1.90 to 2.01) times higher than the odds in the ""less than 19,999 CAD"" category.Conclusions: Subjective mental health contributes highly to life satisfaction, being more strongly associated than other selected previously known factors. Future studies could be useful to deepen our understanding of the interplay between subjective mental health, mental illness and life satisfaction. This may be beneficial for developing public health policies that optimize mental health promotion, illness prevention and treatment of mental disorders to enhance life satisfaction in the general population.","Lombardo, Patrick",10.1186/s12889-018-5235-x,BMC Public Health,the fundamental association between mental health and life satisfaction: results from successive waves of a canadian national survey.,3/12/2018

The authors compared the efficacy of psychodynamic therapy with that of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), hypothesizing nonsignificant differences and the noninferiority of psychodynamic therapy relative to CBT.Method: A total of 341 adults who met DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode and had Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores ?14 were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of individual manualized CBT or short-term psychodynamic supportive therapy. Severely depressed patients (HAM-D score >24) also received antidepressant medication according to protocol. The primary outcome measure was posttreatment remission rate (HAM-D score ?7). Secondary outcome measures included mean posttreatment HAM-D score and patient-rated depression score and 1-year follow-up outcomes. Data were analyzed with generalized estimating equations and mixed-model analyses using intent-to-treat samples. Noninferiority margins were prespecified as an odds ratio of 0.49 for remission rates and a Cohens d value of 0.30 for continuous outcome measures.Results: No statistically significant treatment differences were found for any of the outcome measures. The average posttreatment remission rate was 22.7%. Noninferiority was shown for posttreatment HAM-D and patient-rated depression scores but could not be demonstrated for posttreatment remission rates or any of the follow-up measures.Conclusions: The findings extend the evidence base of psychodynamic therapy for depression but also indicate that time-limited treatment is insufficient for a substantial number of patients encountered in psychiatric outpatient clinics.","Driessen, Ellen",10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12070899,American Journal of Psychiatry,the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy in the outpatient treatment of major depression: a randomized clinical trial.,Sep2013

220,"Objective: The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act requires insurance parity for mental health/substance use disorder and general medical services. Previous research found that parity did not increase mental health/substance use disorder spending and lowered out-of-pocket spending. Whether paritys effects differ by diagnosis is unknown. The authors examined this question in the context of parity implementation in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program.Method: The authors compared mental health/substance use disorder treatment use and spending before and after parity (2000 and 2002, respectively) for two groups: FEHB enrollees diagnosed in 1999 with bipolar disorder, major depression, or adjustment disorder (N=19,094) and privately insured enrollees unaffected by the policy in a comparison national sample (N=10,521). Separate models were fitted for each diagnostic group. A difference-in-difference design was used to control for secular time trends and to better reflect the specific impact of parity on spending and utilization.Results: Total spending was unchanged among enrollees with bipolar disorder and major depression but decreased for those with adjustment disorder (-$62, 99.2% CI=-$133, -$11). Out-of-pocket spending decreased for all three groups (bipolar disorder: -$148, 99.2% CI=-$217, -$85; major depression: -$100, 99.2% CI=-$123, -$77; adjustment disorder: -$68, 99.2% CI=-$84, -$54). Total annual utilization (e.g., medication management visits, psychotropic prescriptions, and mental health/substance use disorder hospitalization bed days) remained unchanged across all diagnoses. Annual psychotherapy visits decreased significantly only for individuals with adjustment disorders (-12%, 99.2% CI=-19%, -4%).Conclusions: Parity implemented under managed care improved financial protection and differentially affected spending and psychotherapy utilization across groups. There was some evidence that resources were preferentially preserved for diagnoses that are typically more severe or chronic and reduced for diagnoses expected to be less so.",Busch AB,10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12030392,American Journal of Psychiatry,"the effects of mental health parity on spending and utilization for bipolar, major depression, and adjustment disorders.",Feb2013

163,"OBJECTIVE A previous study of recovery-oriented assertive community treatment (PACT) found large differences over three years in use of state psychiatric hospitals between PACT participants and consumers in a matched control group, especially for PACT participants with significant previous psychiatric hospitalization. This study extended these findings by examining the timing of PACT effects. METHODS Generalized estimating equation models of monthly cost data for state, local, and crisis hospital use estimated the time-varying effects of participation in one of ten PACT teams in Washington State. Data from PACT participants (N=450) and propensity score-matched consumers (N=450) were included. Additional analyses determined whether effects differed by prior state hospital use. RESULTS Differences in costs between PACT and control participants were largest immediately after PACT enrollment and tapered off. During the first quarter after enrollment, monthly per-person costs for state hospital use were $3,458 lower for PACT enrollees than for control participants. A composite measure of psychiatric hospital costs (state and local hospitals and local crisis stabilization units) declined by $3,539 monthly during the first quarter after PACT enrollment (p.01). Differences were noted up to 27 months after enrollment, when the difference in the composite costs measure became insignificant compared with the prior quarter (months 25-27) (p.05). Differences were larger for PACT enrollees with greater baseline state hospital use. CONCLUSIONS The time-varying estimates may have implications for the length and intensity of ACT enrollment. However, the optimum time for receipt of ACT services needs to be considered in the context of outcomes other than hospitalization alone.","Domino, Marisa E",10.1176/appi.ps.201200096,Psychiatric Services,the effectiveness of recovery-oriented act in reducing hospital use: do effects vary over time?,Apr2013

372,"Background: Suicide, attempted suicide and suicidal thoughts are major public health problems worldwide. Effective face-to-face treatments are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) and Problem Solving Treatment (PST). However, about two-thirds of persons who die by suicide have not been in contact with mental health care services in the preceding year, and many have never been treated. Furthermore, many patients do not disclose their suicidal thoughts to their care provider. This may be out of shame, due to fear of stigma or due to lack of trust in (mental) health care. Since many suicidal individuals seek information online, the internet provides an opportunity to reach suicidal individuals who would not be contacted otherwise. By providing a self-help intervention online, persons can anonymously learn to gain control over their suicidal thoughts. There is convincing evidence that self-help is effective for a number of mental disorders. In this study the effectiveness for suicidal thoughts is examined.Methods/design: In this study, a recently developed self-help intervention will be evaluated in a Randomized Controlled Trial. The intervention is based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and is aimed at subjects who experience mild to moderate suicidal thoughts. This is defined as a score between 1 and 26 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS). Higher and lower scores are excluded. In addition, severely depressed subjects are excluded. In total, 260 subjects will be randomly allocated to the intervention-condition (N = 130) or to the information-control condition (N = 130). Self-report questionnaires will be filled out at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline and 18 weeks after baseline. Primary outcome measure is the reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of hopelessness, anxiety and depression, sleeplessness, worry and quality of life measures.Discussion: This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based self-help intervention for suicidal thoughts.

Sixty-nine percent of all treatment centers and 97% of CMHCs reported dual diagnosis capability. However, 29% of physicians treated both mental illness and addictions, and only 8% had certification in an addiction specialty.

318,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of housing and neighborhood features on residential instability and the costs of mental health services for individuals with chronic mental illness (CMI). DATA SOURCES: Medicaid and service provider data on the mental health service utilization of 670 individuals with CMI between 1988 and 1993 were combined with primary data on housing attributes and costs, as well as census data on neighborhood characteristics. Study participants were living in independent housing units developed under the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Program on Chronic Mental Illness in four of nine demonstration cities between 1988 and 1993. STUDY DESIGN: Participants were assigned on a first-come, first-served basis to housing units as they became available for occupancy after renovation by the housing providers. Multivariate statistical models are used to examine the relationship between features of the residential environment and three outcomes that were measured during the participants occupancy in a study property: residential instability, community-based service costs, and hospital-based service costs. To assess cost-effectiveness, the mental health care cost savings associated with some residential features are compared with the cost of providing housing with these features. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Health service utilization data were obtained from Medicaid and from state and local departments of mental health. Non-mental-health services, substance abuse services, and pharmaceuticals were screened out. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Study participants living in newer and properly maintained buildings had lower mental health care costs and residential instability. Buildings with a richer set of amenity features, neighborhoods with no outward signs of physical deterioration, and neighborhoods with newer housing stock were also associated with reduced mental health care costs. Study participants were more residentially stable in buildings with fewer units and where a greater proportion of tenants were other individuals with CMI. Mental health care costs and residential instability tend to be reduced in neighborhoods with many nonresidential land uses and a higher proportion of renters. Mixed-race neighborhoods are associated with reduced probability of mental health hospitalization, but they also are associated with much higher hospitalization costs if hospitalized. The degree of income mixing in the neighborhood has no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Several of the key findings are consistent with theoretical expectations that higher-quality housing and neighborhoods lead to better mental health outcomes among individuals with CMI. The mental health care cost savings associated with these favorable features far outweigh the costs of developing and operating properties with them. Support for the hypothesis that diverse-disorganized neighborhoods are more accepting of individuals with CMI and, hence, associated with better mental health outcomes, is mixed.",Harkness J,NLM15333112,Health Services Research,the cost-effectiveness of independent housing for the chronically mentally ill: do housing and neighborhood features matter?,Oct2004
177,"OBJECTIVE The authors assessed a states net costs for assisted outpatient treatment, a controversial court-ordered program of community-based mental health services designed to improve outcomes for persons with serious mental illness and a history of repeated hospitalizations attributable to nonadherence with outpatient treatment. METHOD A comprehensive cost analysis was conducted using 36 months of observational data for 634 assisted outpatient treatment participants and 255 voluntary recipients of intensive community-based treatment in New York City and in five counties elsewhere in New York State. Administrative, budgetary, and service claims data were used to calculate and summarize costs for program administration, legal and court services, mental health and other medical treatment, and criminal justice involvement. Adjusted effects of assisted outpatient treatment and voluntary intensive services on total service costs were examined using multivariate time-series regression analysis. RESULTS In the New York City sample, net costs declined 43% in the first year after assisted outpatient treatment began and an additional 13% in the second year. In the five-county sample, costs declined 49% in the first year and an additional 27% in the second year. Psychotropic drug costs increased during the first year after initiation of assisted outpatient treatment, by 40% and 44% in the city and five-county samples, respectively. Regression analyses revealed significant declines in costs associated with both assisted outpatient treatment and voluntary participation in intensive services, although the cost declines associated with assisted outpatient treatment were about twice as large as those seen for voluntary services. CONCLUSIONS Assisted outpatient treatment requires a substantial investment of state resources but can reduce overall service costs for persons with serious mental illness. For those who do not qualify for assisted outpatient treatment, voluntary participation in intensive community-based services may also reduce overall service costs over time, depending on characteristics of the target population and local service system.","Swanson, Jeffrey W",10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12091152,American Journal of Psychiatry,the cost of assisted outpatient treatment: can it save states money?,Dec2013

358,"Background: Maternal depression carries a major public health burden for mothers and their infants, yet there is a substantial treatment gap for this condition in low-resourced regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. To address this treatment gap, the strategy of ""task sharing"" has been proposed, involving the delivery of interventions by non-specialist health workers trained and supervised by specialists in routine healthcare delivery systems. Several psychological interventions have shown benefit in treating maternal depression, but few have been rigorously evaluated using a task sharing approach. The proposed trial will be the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a task sharing model of delivering care for women with maternal depression in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this RCT is to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a task sharing counseling intervention for maternal depression in South Africa.Methods/design: The study is an individual-level two-arm RCT. A total of 420 depressed pregnant women will be recruited from two ante-natal clinics in a low-income township area of Cape Town, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to screen for depression; 210 women will be randomly allocated to each of the intervention and control arms. The intervention group will be given six sessions of basic counseling over a period of 3 to 4 months, provided by trained community health workers (CHW)s. The control group will receive three monthly phone calls from a CHW trained to conduct phone calls but not basic counseling. The primary outcome measure is the 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17). The outcome measures will be applied at the baseline assessment, and at three follow-up points: 1 month before delivery, and 3 and 12 months after delivery. The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat and secondary analyses will be on a per protocol population. The primary outcome measure will be analyzed using linear regression adjusting for baseline symptom severity measured using the HDRS-17.Discussion: The findings of this trial can provide policy makers with evidence regarding the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of structured psychological interventions for maternal depression delivered by appropriately trained and supervised non-specialist CHWs in sub-Saharan Africa.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov): NCT01977326, registered on 24/10/2013; Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.pactr.org): PACTR201403000676264, registered on 11/10/2013.","Lund, Crick",10.1186/1745-6215-15-457,Trials,"task sharing of a psychological intervention for maternal depression in khayelitsha, south africa: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.",2014

343,"Background: The prevalence of depression is high and the elderly have an increased risk of developing chronic course. International data suggest that depression in the elderly is under-recognised, the latency before clinicians provide a treatment plan is longer and elderly patients with depression are not offered psychotherapy to the same degree as younger patients. Although recommendations for the treatment of elderly patients with depression exist, health-care professionals adhere to these recommendations to a limited degree only. We conducted a systematic review to identify recommendations for managing depression in the elderly and prioritised six recommendations. We identified and prioritised the determinants of practice related to the implementation of these recommendations in primary care, and subsequently discussed and prioritised interventions to address the identified determinants. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of these tailored interventions for the six recommendations for the management of elderly patients with depression in primary care.Methods/design: We will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomised trial comparing the implementation of the six recommendations using tailored interventions with usual care. We will randomise 80 municipalities into one of two groups: an intervention group, to which we will deliver tailored interventions to implement the six recommendations, and a control group, to which we will not deliver any intervention. We will randomise municipalities rather than patients, individual clinicians or practices, because we will deliver the intervention for the first three recommendations at the municipal level and we want to minimise the risk of contamination across GP practices for the other three recommendations. The primary outcome is the proportion of actions taken by GPs that are consistent with the recommendations.Discussion: This trial will investigate whether a tailored implementation approach is an effective strategy for improving collaborative care in the municipalities and health-care professionals practice towards elderly patients with depression in primary care. The effectiveness evaluation described in this protocol will be accompanied with a process evaluation exploring why and how the interventions were effective or ineffective.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01913236.","Aakhus, Eivind",10.1186/1745-6215-15-16,Trials,tailored interventions to implement recommendations for elderly patients with depression in primary care: a study protocol for a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial.,2014

90,"Objective: Assertive community treatment (ACT) is one of the few evidence-based practices for adults with severe mental illness. Interest has slowly waned for ACT implementation. Yet ACT remains an appealing services platform to achieve the triple aim of health care reform (improved health outcomes, reduced cost, and improved satisfaction) through integration of primary care and behavioral health services. This review highlights the evidence for ACT to improve general medical outcomes, reduce treatment costs, and increase access to treatment.Methods: Using a comprehensive list of relevant search terms, the authors performed a systematic literature database search for articles published through November 2015, resulting in ten articles for inclusion.Results: No studies reported on clinical outcomes of general medical comorbidities or on mortality of ACT clients. Half of the studies reporting utilization (three of six) found a decrease in emergency room usage, and three of four studies identified an increase in outpatient primary care visits. Most studies found no increase in overall medical care costs. Of the few studies reporting on quality of life, most found mild to moderate improvements.Conclusions: To date, rigorous scientific examination of the effect of ACT on the general health of the populations it serves has not been undertaken. Given ACTs similarity to emerging chronic illness medical management models, the approach seems like a natural fit for improving general medical outcomes of persons with severe mental illnesses. More research is needed that investigates the current effect of ACT teams on general medical outcomes, treatment costs, and access to care.","Vanderlip, Erik R.",10.1176/appi.ps.201600100,Psychiatric Services,systematic literature review of general health care interventions within programs of assertive community treatment.,Mar2017

95,"Objective: The study evaluated the effect of Californias Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) on the structure, volume, location, and patient centeredness of Los Angeles County public mental health services.Methods: This prospective mixed-methods study (2006-2013) was based in five Los Angeles County public mental health clinics, all with usual care and three with full-service partnerships (FSPs). FSPs are MHSA-funded programs designed to ""do whatever it takes"" to provide intensive, recovery-oriented, team-based, integrated services for clients with severe mental illness. FSPs were compared with usual care on outpatient services received (claims data) and on organizational climate, recovery orientation, and provider-client working alliance (surveys and semistructured interviews), with regression adjustment for client and provider characteristics.Results: In the first year after admission, FSP clients (N=174) received significantly more outpatient services than did usual care clients (N=298) (5,238 versus 1,643 minutes, p<.001), and a larger proportion of these services were field based (22% versus 2%, p<.001). Compared with usual care clients, FSP clients reported more recovery-oriented services (p<.001) and a better provider-client working alliance (p=.01). Compared with usual care providers (N=130), FSP providers (N=42) reported more stress (p<.001) and lower morale (p<.001).Conclusions: Los Angeles Countys public mental health system was able to transform service delivery in response to well-funded policy mandates. For providers, a structure emphasizing accountability and patient centeredness was associated with greater stress, despite smaller caseloads. For clients, service structure and volume created opportunities to build stronger provider-client relationships and address their needs and goals.","Starks, Sarah L.",10.1176/appi.ps.201500390,Psychiatric Services,system transformation under the california mental health services act: implementation of full-service partnerships in l.a. county.,Jun2017

174,"Background/purpose: Mental health promotion campaigns require a good understanding of public attitudes and mental health literacy. Few studies have investigated changes in these two aspects over time. We aimed to examine such changes and their associations with help-seeking preference in Taiwan.Methods: Data were extracted from the Taiwan Social Change Survey (1990, 1995, and 2000) based on national representative samples. Each wave of the surveys included four questions about attitudes toward severe mental illness, a case vignette describing depressive and anxiety symptoms to evaluate respondents mental health literacy, and their preference of medical and/or informal help-seeking if they develop such symptoms. Mental and physical health statuses measured using the Chinese Health Questionnaire and self-reported chronic physical illnesses were included as covariates.Results: There were 2531, 2075, and 1892 respondents in the three waves of the surveys, respectively. During the 1990 s, approximately one in four to five Taiwanese held some misconceptions toward mental illness. The attitudes toward mental illness were generally not associated with medical or informal help-seeking preference after statistical adjustment. However, respondents viewing symptoms in the vignette as physical or mental in origin were more willing to seek help than those who saw these symptoms as not being an illness.Conclusion: Attribution of depressive and anxiety symptoms appeared to be more likely to influence help-seeking behaviors than attitudes toward mental illness. Enhancing public mental health literacy toward depression may help facilitate help-seeking in response to potential mental illness.","Wu, Chia-Yi",10.1016/j.jfma.2013.03.004,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association,"surveys of medical seeking preference, mental health literacy, and attitudes toward mental illness in taiwan, 1990-2000.",Jan2014

306,"Objective: In a randomized controlled trial, a vocationally integrated program of assertive community treatment (ACT) was compared with a certified clubhouse in the delivery of supported employment services.Methods: Employment rates, total work hours, and earnings for 121 adults with serious mental illness interested in work were compared with published benchmark figures for exemplary supported employment programs. The two programs were then compared on service engagement, retention, and employment outcomes in regression analyses that controlled for background characteristics, program preference, and vocational service receipt.Results: Outcomes for 63 ACT and 58 clubhouse participants met or exceeded most published outcomes for specialized supported employment teams. Compared with the clubhouse program, the ACT program had significantly (p<.05) better service engagement (ACT, 98 percent; clubhouse, 74 percent) and retention (ACT, 79 percent; clubhouse, 58 percent) over 24 months, but there was no significant difference in employment rates (ACT, 64 percent; clubhouse, 47 percent). Compared with ACT participants, clubhouse participants worked significantly longer (median of 199 days versus 98 days) for more total hours (median of 494 hours versus 234 hours) and earned more (median of $3,456 versus $1,252 total earnings). Better work performance by clubhouse participants was partially attributable to higher pay.Conclusions: Vocationally integrated ACT and certified clubhouses can achieve employment outcomes similar to those of exemplary supported employment teams. Certified clubhouses can effectively provide supported employment along with other rehabilitative services, and the ACT program can ensure continuous integration of supported employment with clinical care.",Macias C,NLM17035557,Psychiatric Services,supported employment outcomes of a randomized controlled trial of act and clubhouse models.,Oct2006
110,"Background: Individual placement and support (IPS) is a vocational rehabilitation programme that was developed in the USA to improve employment outcomes for people with severe mental illness. Its ability to be generalised to other countries and its effectiveness in varying economic conditions remains to be ascertained.Aims: To investigate whether IPS is effective across international settings and in different economic conditions.Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing IPS with traditional vocational services was undertaken; 17 studies, as well as 2 follow-up studies, were included. Meta-regressions were carried out to examine whether IPS effectiveness varied according to geographic location, unemployment rates or gross domestic product (GDP) growth.Results: The overall pooled risk ratio for competitive employment using IPS compared with traditional vocational rehabilitation was 2.40 (95% CI 1.99-2.90). Meta-regressions indicated that neither geographic area nor unemployment rates affected the overall effectiveness of IPS. Even when a countrys GDP growth was less than 2% IPS was significantly more effective than traditional vocational training, and its benefits remained evident over 2 years.Conclusions: Individual placement and support is an effective intervention across a variety of settings and economic conditions and is more than twice as likely to lead to competitive employment when compared with traditional vocational rehabilitation.","Modini, Matthew",10.1192/bjp.bp.115.165092,British Journal of Psychiatry,supported employment for people with severe mental illness: systematic review and meta-analysis of the international evidence.,Jul2016

360,"Background: Forensic mental health services have largely ignored examining patients views on the nature of the services offered to them. A structured communication approach (DIALOG) has been developed with the aim of placing the patients perspective on their care at the heart of the discussions between patients and clinicians. The effectiveness of the structured communication approach in community mental health services has been demonstrated, but no trial has taken place in a secure psychiatric setting. This pilot study is evaluating a 6-month intervention combining DIALOG with principles of solution-focused therapy on quality of life in medium-secure settings.Methods and Design: A cluster randomized controlled trial design is being employed to conduct a 36-month pilot study. Participants are recruited from six medium-secure inpatient services, with 48 patients in the intervention group and 48 in the control group. The intervention uses a structured communication approach. It comprises six meetings between patient and nurse held monthly over a 6-month period. During each meeting, patients rate their satisfaction with a range of life and treatment domains with responses displayed on a tablet. The rating is followed by a discussion of how to improve the current situation in those domains identified by the patient. Assessments take place prior to the intervention (baseline), at 6 months (postintervention) and at 12 months (follow-up). The primary outcome is the patients self-reported quality of life.Discussion: This study aims to (1) establish the feasibility of the trial design as the basis for determining the viability of a large full-scale trial, (2) determine the variability of the outcomes of interest (quality of life, levels of satisfaction, disturbance, ward climate and engagement with services), (3) estimate the costs of the intervention and (4) refine the intervention following the outcome of the study based upon the experiences of the nurses and patients. The intervention allows patients to have a greater say in how they are treated and targets care in areas that patients identify as important to them. It is intended to establish systems that support meaningful patient and caregiver involvement and participation.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN34145189.","Macinnes, Douglas",10.1186/1745-6215-14-257,Trials,study to assess the effect of a structured communication approach on quality of life in secure mental health settings (comquol): study protocol for a pilot cluster randomized trial.,2013

212,"Background: Stress, depression, and anxiety affect 15 to 25% of pregnant women. However, fewer than 20% of prenatal care providers assess and treat mental health problems and fewer than 20% of pregnant women seek mental healthcare. For those who seek treatment, the lack of health system integration and existing barriers frequently prevent treatment access. Without treatment, poor prenatal mental health can persist for years and impact future maternal, child, and family well-being.Methods/design: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated process of online psychosocial assessment, referral, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for pregnant women compared to usual prenatal care (no formal screening or specialized care). The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization. Secondary outcomes are postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem; sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age; birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development; parenting stress/competence; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. Pregnant women are eligible if they: 1) are <28 weeks gestation; 2) speak/read English; 3) are willing to complete email questionnaires; 4) have no, low, or moderate psychosocial risk on screening at recruitment; and 5) are eligible for CBT. A sample of 816 women will be recruited from large, urban primary care clinics and allocation is by computer-generated randomization. Women in the intervention group will complete an online psychosocial assessment, and those with mild or moderate depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms then complete six interactive cognitive behavior therapy modules. All women will complete email questionnaires at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization and at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Clinic-based providers and researchers conducting chart abstraction and analysis are blinded. Qualitative interviews with 8 to 10 healthcare providers and 15 to 30 intervention group women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Results of this trial will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an integrated approach to prenatal mental healthcare and the use of highly accessible computer-based psychosocial assessment and CBT on maternal, infant, and family-based outcomes.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01901796.","Kingston, Dawn",10.1186/1745-6215-15-72,Trials,"study protocol for a randomized, controlled, superiority trial comparing the clinical and cost- effectiveness of integrated online mental health assessment-referral-care in pregnancy to usual prenatal care on prenatal and postnatal mental health and infant health and development: the integrated maternal psychosocial assessment to care trial (impact).",2014

173,"OBJECTIVES: This study compared recidivism outcomes among criminal offenders with mental illness who were assigned to a mental health court (MHC) or a traditional criminal court. It also explored potential differences in outcomes between subgroups of offenders, including felony and misdemeanor offenders and violent and nonviolent offenders. METHODS: Data were obtained from court databases. Offenders in the MHC (N=198) and the traditional criminal court (N=198) were matched by propensity scores and followed for 12 months after the index offense. Data for the 12 months preceding the index offense were obtained for MHC participants. Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted, using both between-group and within-subjects designs. RESULTS: After control for covariates, logistic and Cox regressions indicated that MHC assignment predicted a lower overall rate of recidivism and longer time to rearrest for a new charge compared with assignment to traditional court. The groups did not significantly differ on the severity of the offense associated with rearrest. The findings largely held for felony, misdemeanor, violent, and nonviolent offenders, with the exception of analyses involving time to rearrest for violent offenders. Within-subjects analyses suggested that after MHC participation, there were improvements in occurrence of rearrest and time to rearrest but a tendency for rearrest to be associated with more severe offenses. Within the MHC group, recidivism outcomes did not significantly differ by class of offense. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that an MHC can be effective in reducing recidivism among offenders with mental illness and also indicate that persons who commit more severe offenses may be appropriate candidates for MHC.","Anestis, Joye C",10.1176/appi.ps.201300305,Psychiatric Services,stopping the revolving door: effectiveness of mental health court in reducing recidivism by mentally ill offenders.,Sep2014

236,"Objectives: Stigma associated with mental illness is an important yet understudied issue among Latinos. This study examined the psychometric properties of four stigma measures with a sample of Spanish-speaking Latino primary care patients. The study evaluated the scale for Perceived Discrimination Devaluation (PDD), the Stigma Concerns About Mental Health Care (SCMHC) scale, the Latino Scale for Antidepressant Stigma (LSAS), and the Social Distance (SD) scale.Methods: Participants (N=200) were low-income Latinos who were screened for depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and asked about their depression treatment history, and they completed the four stigma measures at two time points (25 and 30 months from baseline). The four stigma measures were examined for internal consistency, convergent validity, construct validity, and criterion-related validity.Results: The factor-analytic results generally provided support for the construct validity of the measures. The four stigma measures also demonstrated internal consistency between two time points. Patients who reported greater social distance from individuals with depression were more likely to have been receiving treatment for emotional care in the past three months (odds ratio OR=.70, p<.05). Also, Latinos who scored high on the SCMHC (OR=.64, p<.05) and LSAS (OR=.77, p<.05) were less likely to have been taking antidepressant medications.Conclusions: The SCMHC, LSAS, and SD scales received support for their reliability and construct validity. Results also showed some support for their criterion-related validity. A more mixed picture emerged for the PDD. Stigma ratings were associated with depression treatment utilization. Stigma ratings changed over time and were associated with treatment experiences.",Interian A,10.1176/ps.2010.61.4.373,Psychiatric Services,stigma and depression treatment utilization among latinos: utility of four stigma measures.,Apr2010

183,"Objective: To introduce stepped care as a method of organizing the delivery of treatments, and to consider the factors necessary for implementation. Method: Stepped care is described within the context of strategies such as collaborative care that aim to increase access to mental health care through the improved coordination of care between primary and specialist mental health services. Results from the implementation of stepped care in the United Kingdom and elsewhere are used to highlight the factors required for introducing stepped care into routine services. Issues to address when implementing high-volume services for common mental health problems are derived from this experience. Results: Stepped care sits within the continuum of organizational systems, from situations where responsibility rests almost entirely with primary care clinicians to systems where all patients are managed by specialists for the entire duration of their treatment. Its core principles of delivering low-burden treatments first, followed by careful patient progress monitoring to step patients up to more intensive treatment, are easy to articulate but lead to considerable implementation diversity when services attempt to work in this manner. Services need to ensure they have specific staff competency training, including skills in delivering evidence-based treatments, access to telephony, and smart patient management informatics systems. Conclusions: Stepped care can provide the delivery system for supported self-management. To be successful, health systems need high levels of clinical outcome data and appropriately trained workers. Further attention is required to ensure equity of access and to reduce patient attrition in these systems.",Richards DA,NLM22480585,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,stepped care: a method to deliver increased access to psychological therapies.,Apr2012

207,"OBJECTIVE The authors investigated levels of social inclusion among service users of two types of psychiatric community housing programs in the Netherlands. METHODS A large-scale cross-sectional survey was conducted that included service users of community housing programs (N=255) and their key workers (N=75). Data on social inclusion-participating in activities, receiving and making visits, and vocational participation-were collected through a service user diary. Univariate regression analyses were performed with the social inclusion variables as the dependent variables and type of housing program (supported independent living versus residential care) as the independent variable. RESULTS Service users living independently were more likely to feel socially included, in terms of activities and visits, than residents. Type of housing program was not associated with vocational participation. CONCLUSIONS Although service users living independently were more likely than residents to be socially included, their vocational participation was similar to that of residents. It seems that for both groups of service user, it is important to improve the availability of vocational interventions or programs.","De Heer-Wunderink, Charlotte",10.1176/appi.ps.201100538,Psychiatric Services,social inclusion of people with severe mental illness living in community housing programs.,Nov2012

227,"Objective: Aims of the study were to describe behavioral health treatment utilization patterns of community-dwelling older adults with depressive symptoms over a six-month period and to identify factors associated with treatment use, guided by a theoretical model emphasizing the dynamic nature of treatment use patterns over time and social context.Methods: A total of 144 participants ?65 years old with depressive symptoms completed an in-person baseline interview and six monthly telephone follow-up interviews. Outcomes at each follow-up included the use of antidepressants or counseling. Covariates included personal and social context variables.Results: Approximately half of the participants (N=70, 48%) received no formal treatment (antidepressant prescription or counseling). Treatment use or nonuse did not change for most participants. More participants with severe symptoms received antidepressants (25%-37%) than did those with milder symptoms (10%-14%), although more participants in the latter group started (milder, 62%,versus severe, 49%) and stopped (milder, 77%, versus severe, 26%) antidepressant treatment at least once. Fewer individuals received counseling overall, with no clear patterns by symptom severity. In multivariate longitudinal analyses, treatment use at follow-up was independently associated with younger age, current major depressive episode, baseline use of antidepressant, intention to begin a new treatment at baseline, and receipt of advice to seek treatment.Conclusions: Over a six-month period, most older adults with depressive symptoms in this study continued their use or nonuse of mental health treatment. Demographic, need, attitudinal, and social variables were related to treatment use over time.

108,"Background: Shared decision-making (SDM) is an emergent research topic in the field of mental health care and is considered to be a central component of a recovery-oriented system. Despite the evidence suggesting the benefits of this change in the power relationship between users and practitioners, the method has not been widely implemented in clinical practice. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate decisional and information needs among users with mental illness as a prerequisite for the development of a decision support tool aimed at supporting SDM in community-based mental health services in Sweden. Methods: Three semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with 22 adult users with mental illness. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using a directed content analysis. This method was used to develop an in-depth understanding of the decisional process as well as to validate and conceptually extend Elwyn et al.s model of SDM. Results: The model Elwyn et al. have created for SDM in somatic care fits well for mental health services, both in terms of process and content. However, the results also suggest an extension of the model because decisions related to mental illness are often complex and involve a number of life domains. Issues related to social context and individual recovery point to the need for a preparation phase focused on establishing cooperation and mutual understanding as well as a clear follow-up phase that allows for feedback and adjustments to the decision-making process. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The current study contributes to a deeper understanding of decisional and information needs among users of community-based mental health services that may reduce barriers to participation in decision-making. The results also shed light on attitudinal, relationship-based, and cognitive factors that are important to consider in adapting SDM in the mental health system.","Grim, Katarina",10.3402/qhw.v11.30563,International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health & Well-Being,shared decision-making in mental health care--a user perspective on decisional needs in community-based services.,2016

239,"Objective: There are growing concerns about the mental health status of returning veterans from the recent conflicts in Iraq (Operation Iraq Freedom OIF) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom OEF) and about retention in mental health treatment of veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study obtained data from veterans who had a new diagnosis of PTSD from fiscal year (FY) 2004 to FY 2007 and determined whether retention in PTSD treatment and the number of mental health visits were comparable among OIF-OEF veterans and veterans from other service eras.Methods: Data from the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense were combined to identify veterans who were newly diagnosed as having PTSD (N=204,184) and their service era. Survival analysis assessed dropout from mental health treatment within one year from initial diagnosis, and Poisson regression assessed the association between war era and number of mental health visits.Results: Although a smaller proportion of OIF-OEF veterans than Vietnam-era veterans remained in treatment for more than one year (37.6% versus 46.0%), when the analyses adjusted for demographic characteristics and comorbid diagnoses, OIF-OEF veterans were less likely than Vietnam-era veterans to discontinue psychiatric treatment for PTSD within one year. OIF-OEF veterans attended fewer mental health visits than Vietnam-era veterans did (8.15 versus 13.37). However, multivariate analysis indicated that, after the analyses adjusted for confounding factors, OIF-OEF veterans had significantly more visits than Vietnam-era veterans associated with PTSD treatment.Conclusions: Retention and numbers of visits were found to be lower among OIF-OEF veterans primarily as a function of age and comorbid conditions and not as a function of the particular war era. Interventions should be designed to target specific barriers to care that may interfere with continued engagement in mental health services.","Harpaz-Rotem, Ilan",10.1176/ps.62.1.pss6201_0022,Psychiatric Services,serving those who served: retention of newly returning veterans from iraq and afghanistan in mental health treatment.,Jan2011
329,"OBJECTIVES: This study tested a psychiatric rehabilitation approach for organizing and delivering services to street-dwelling persons with severe mental illness. METHODS: Street-dwelling persons with severe mental illness were randomly assigned to the experimental program (called Choices) or to standard treatment in New York City. We assessed study participants at baseline and at 6-month intervals over 24 months, using measures of service use, quality of life, health, mental health, and social psychological status. The average deviation from baseline summary statistic was employed to assess change. RESULTS: Compared with persons in standard treatment (n = 77), members of the experimental group (n = 91) were more likely to attend a day program (53% vs 27%), had less difficulty in meeting their basic needs, spent less time on the streets (55% vs 28% reduction), and spent more time in community housing (21% vs 9% increase). They showed greater improvement in life satisfaction and experienced a greater reduction in psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: With an appropriate service model, it is possible to engage disaffiliated populations, expand their use of human services, and improve their housing conditions, quality of life, and mental health status.",Shern DL,NLM11111259,American Journal of Public Health,serving street-dwelling individuals with psychiatric disabilities: outcomes of a psychiatric rehabilitation clinical trial.,Dec2000

Participants with comorbid substance dependence were significantly more likely than those without comorbid substance dependence to report unmet mental health treatment need. However, barriers to mental health care were remarkably similar across groups, with financial barriers being the most common in all groups.Conclusions: Participants with major depression comorbid with substance dependence used more mental health services but also perceived more unmet need for such care than individuals without such comorbidity. However, barriers to mental health care were similar across groups with and without comorbidity. Policies aimed at expanding insurance coverage and mental health parity would likely benefit individuals with major depression and substance dependence comorbidity even more than those without such comorbidity.","Chen, Lian-Yu",10.1176/appi.ps.201200289,Psychiatric Services,service use and barriers to mental health care among adults with major depression and comorbid substance dependence.,Sep2013
324,"OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the second of the two core questions around which the ACCESS (Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports) evaluation was designed: Does better integration of service systems improve the treatment outcomes of homeless persons with severe mental illness? METHODS: The ACCESS program provided technical support and about $250,000 a year for four years to nine sites to implement strategies to promote systems integration. These sites, along with nine comparison sites, also received funds to support outreach and assertive community treatment programs to assist 100 clients a year at each site. Outcome data were obtained at baseline and three and 12 months later from 7,055 clients across four annual cohorts at all sites. RESULTS: Clients at all sites demonstrated improvement in outcome measures. However, the clients at the experimental sites showed no greater improvement on measures of mental health or housing outcomes across the four cohorts than those at the comparison sites. More extensive implementation of systems integration strategies was unrelated to these outcomes. However, clients of sites that became more integrated, regardless of the degree of implementation or whether the sites were experimental sites or comparison sites, had progressively better housing outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions designed to increase the level of systems integration in the ACCESS demonstration did not result in better client outcomes.",Rosenheck RA,NLM12161669,Psychiatric Services,service systems integration and outcomes for mentally ill homeless persons in the access program...access community care and effective services and supports,Aug2002
276,"Objectives: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients in depression treatment have high suicide rates after psychiatric hospitalization, antidepressant starts, and dosage changes. Policy makers have recommended closer monitoring during these periods to reduce suicide. This study assessed the frequency of high-risk periods in clinical settings, the levels of monitoring provided during these periods, and the estimated costs of providing monitoring consistent with the most stringent Food and Drug Administration recommendation for treatment periods after antidepressant change (seven visits in the first 12 weeks).Methods: Monitoring visits were identified in the 12-week period after antidepressant starts and dosage changes and after discharge from psychiatric hospitalization for 100,000 randomly selected VA patients in depression treatment between April 1, 1999, and September 30, 2004. Incremental costs of providing intensive monitoring were estimated by using VA Health Economics Resource Center average cost data.Results: Patients averaged less than one high-risk period each year. They completed an average of 2.4 monitoring visits during the 12-week period after antidepressant treatment events and 4.9 visits after psychiatric hospitalization. Providing intensive monitoring would cost an additional $408-$537 for each high-risk period after antidepressant treatment events and $313-$341 for each high-risk period after psychiatric hospitalization. During fiscal year 2004 providing intensive monitoring during all high-risk periods would have cost an additional $183-$270 million. Providing intensive monitoring only after psychiatric hospitalizations would have cost an additional $15-$17 million.Conclusions: Providing intensive monitoring for VA patients in depression treatment during all high-risk periods for suicide would require substantial services reorganization and incremental expenditures. Modest expenditures would support intensive monitoring during the highest-risk period that follows psychiatric hospitalization.",Valenstein M,10.1176/appi.ps.60.4.439,Psychiatric Services,service implications of providing intensive monitoring during high-risk periods for suicide among va patients with depression.,Apr2009

286,"OBJECTIVE: Costs of treating child psychiatric disorders fall on educational, primary care, juvenile justice, and social service agencies as well as on psychiatric services. The authors estimated multiagency mental health costs by integrating service unit costs with utilization rates in an 11-county area. Using psychiatric diagnoses made independently of service use records, the authors calculated costs across agencies as well as the extent of unmet need for psychiatric care. METHOD: Annual parent and child reports were used to measure mental health care needs and units of service across 21 types of settings for the population-based Great Smoky Mountain Study sample of 1,420 adolescents from ages 13 to 16. Unit costs for services were generated from information from service providers and records. The authors calculated costs overall, costs by type of service, and costs by diagnosis. RESULTS: Average annual costs per adolescent treated were $3,146. Juvenile justice and inpatient/residential facilities accounted for well over half of the total costs. Costs for youths with two or more diagnoses were twice as much as costs of those with a single disorder. Among adolescents with service needs, 66.9% received no services. Public health insurance was associated with higher rates of specialty mental health care than either private insurance or no insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Annual costs across all services were three to four times greater than recent health insurance estimates alone. Many costs for adolescents with mental health problems were borne by agencies not designed primarily to provide psychiatric or psychological services. Only one in three adolescents needing psychiatric care received any mental health services.",Costello EJ,NLM17202542,American Journal of Psychiatry,"service costs of caring for adolescents with mental illness in a rural community, 1993-2000.",Jan2007

132,"Background: Chronic insomnia is a prevalent disorder associated with significant psychosocial, health, and economic impacts. Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) and benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BzRA) medications are the most widely supported therapeutic approaches for insomnia management. However, few investigations have directly compared their relative and combined benefits, and even fewer have tested the benefits of sequential treatment for those who do not respond to initial insomnia therapy. Moreover, insomnia treatment studies have been limited by small, highly screened study samples, fixed-dose, and fixed-agent pharmacotherapy strategies that do not represent usual clinical practices. This study will address these limitations.Methods/design: This is a two-site randomized controlled trial, which will enroll 224 adults who meet the criteria for a chronic insomnia disorder with or without comorbid psychiatric disorders. Prospective participants will complete clinical assessments and polysomnography and then will be randomly assigned to first-stage therapy involving either behavioral therapy (BT) or zolpidem. Treatment outcomes will be assessed after 6 weeks, and treatment remitters will be followed for the next 12 months on maintenance therapy. Those not achieving remission will be offered randomization to a second, 6-week treatment, again involving either pharmacotherapy (zolpidem or trazodone) or psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy (CT)). All participants will be re-evaluated 12 weeks after the protocol initiation and at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. Insomnia remission, defined categorically as a score < 8 on the Insomnia Severity Index, a patient-reported outcome, will serve as the primary endpoint for treatment comparisons. Secondary outcomes will include sleep parameters derived from daily sleep diaries and from polysomnography, subjective measures of fatigue, mood, quality of life, and functional impairments; and measures of adverse events; dropout rates; and treatment acceptability. Centrally trained therapists will administer therapies according to manualized, albeit flexible, treatment algorithms.Discussion: This clinical trial will provide new information about optimal treatment sequencing and will have direct implication for the development of clinical guidelines for managing chronic insomnia with and without comorbid psychiatric conditions.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01651442 , Protocol version 4, 20 April 2011, registered 26 June 2012.","Morin, Charles M.",10.1186/s13063-016-1242-3,Trials,sequential psychological and pharmacological therapies for comorbid and primary insomnia: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,3/3/2016

Further analysis found that those who self-cut were three and a half times more likely to report infrequent condom use than those who did not self-cut, even after the analysis controlled for sexual abuse history and HIV prevention self-efficacy.

303,"OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have shown that the highest risk for first onset of depression occurs in women of childbearing years and that there is a strong association between lifetime rates of depressive disorders in mothers and their offspring. This association is found regardless of whether the mother or child is the targeted patient. However, little is known about rates of current depression in mothers who bring their offspring to outpatient clinics for evaluation and/or treatment of depression. This information might be useful in developing intervention strategies. METHOD: One hundred seventeen mothers bringing their offspring for evaluation or treatment for depression were screened with the Patient Problem Questionnaire to determine current symptoms of depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse as well as current psychiatric treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-six (31%) of the mothers screened positive on the Patient Problem Questionnaire for a current psychiatric disorder. Sixteen (14%) screened positive for current major depression, 20 (17%) for panic disorder, 20 (17%) for generalized anxiety disorder, two (2%) for alcohol abuse, and one (1%) for drug abuse. In addition, 50 (43%) of the mothers had psychiatric symptoms that did not meet the diagnostic threshold for any of the above disorders. Twenty-six (22%) of mothers expressed suicidal ideation or intent. Only five (31%) of the 16 mothers diagnosed with major depression were currently receiving any psychiatric treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of mothers bringing their offspring for evaluation or treatment of depression were themselves currently depressed and untreated.

250,"Objective: Assertive community treatment teams have been criticized as being inherently coercive; however, base rates of control practices used by teams have not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to assess the rates at which different forms of agency control, such as involuntary outpatient commitment, representative payeeship, intensive medication monitoring, and agency-supervised housing, were used by assertive community treatment teams. Also examined were program, practitioner, and consumer correlates of agency control practices.Methods: A statewide survey was conducted of 23 assertive community treatment teams serving consumers with severe mental illness. Data were collected on both team attributes and practitioner attributes.Results: Extent of agency control was highly variable across sites. Intensive medication monitoring and representative payeeship were the most frequently used agency control practices. The strongest predictor of agency control was having a higher percentage of consumers on the caseload who were diagnosed as having a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. Fidelity to the assertive community treatment model was not associated with agency control. However, lower quality of basic clinical services (for example, assessment and treatment planning) was associated with greater use of agency-supervised housing. Pessimistic practitioner attitudes were not significantly associated with agency control, but practitioner education was negatively associated with both representative payeeship and intensive medication monitoring.Conclusions: Assertive community treatment teams differed widely in their scope of agency control, and this variation was not associated with fidelity to the model. Consumer characteristics, such as a schizophrenia spectrum disorder and active substance use, were most closely associated with agency control.",Moser LL,10.1176/appi.ps.60.7.922,Psychiatric Services,scope of agency control: assertive community treatment teams supervision of consumers.,Jul2009

Patients were assessed for PTSD diagnosis and treatment initiation on the screening day and ? 7 days, ? 12 weeks, ? 6 months, and ? 1 year after screening positive. The service setting on screening day was categorized as primary care only, same-day primary care-mental health integration (PC-MHI), or same-day specialty mental health care. Multivariable generalized estimating equations logistic regression was used to estimate associations between category of screening day services and diagnosis and treatment initiation, with adjustment for demographic characteristics, prior psychiatric diagnoses, prior VHA service utilization, and PTSD screen score.Results: Of the 21,427 patients with positive PTSD screens, 10,809 (50.4%) received a diagnosis within one year of screening positive. Same-day PC-MHI services were associated with greater odds of PTSD diagnosis, both on the same day as (odds ratio OR=2.23) and one year (OR=1.67) after screening positive compared with primary care-only services (p<.001). Among those who received a diagnosis on the same day as their positive screen, same-day PC-MHI services were associated with increased odds of initiating PTSD treatment (OR=3.39) within 12 weeks of diagnosis, compared with primary care only (p<.001).Conclusions: Same-day integrated mental health services may help facilitate PTSD diagnosis and treatment initiation after a positive screen.","Bohnert, Kipling M.",10.1176/appi.ps.201500035,Psychiatric Services,same-day integrated mental health care and ptsd diagnosis and treatment among vha primary care patients with positive ptsd screens.,Jan2016

This study assessed the association between symptoms and patient perceptions of family relationships. The sample of 226 outpatient Veterans diagnosed with SMI, whose relatives had low contact rates with treatment staff, was enrolled in a study that used shared decision making to consider family involvement in care. We analyzed baseline data using multiple regressions to understand the unique effect that positive, negative, and depressive symptoms have on perceptions of family relationships, including general functioning, problem solving, communication, support, satisfaction, conflict, and distress. Greater depressive and disorganized symptoms were significant, unique predictors of perceptions of poorer communication and problem solving, while higher levels of expressive negative symptoms--blunted affect, lack of spontaneity, and motor retardation--were unique predictors of better communication and problem solving. More depressive symptoms also significantly predicted perceptions of greater family conflict and distress. While we cannot assume causation, these associations underscore the important role of depression and expressive negative symptoms in adopting a family-centered approach in the care of persons with SMI.","Haselden, Morgan",10.1682/JRRD.2015.08.0158,Journal of Rehabilitation Research & Development,relationship between symptoms and family relationships in veterans with serious mental illness.,2016

252,"OBJECTIVE: Despite large numbers of mentally ill offenders in prisons, few studies of mentally ill offenders released from prison have been conducted. This study describes such a population of mentally ill offenders, the postrelease services they received, new offenses they committed, and factors associated with recidivism. METHODS: The authors reviewed electronic files and archived medical charts from the state corrections department to identify mentally ill offenders who left Washington state prisons in 1996 and 1997. Data on the individuals identified were then provided by several public agencies. Summary statistics were computed on subjects characteristics and postrelease outcomes, and logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables that predicted convictions of new felonies and new crimes against persons. RESULTS: A total of 337 mental ill offenders were identified. Men and women differed with regard to offenses, diagnoses, rates of drug abuse, and use of mental health resources. Although most subjects (73 percent) received postrelease social or mental health services, few received clinically meaningful levels of service during the first year after release. Charges for new crimes or supervision violations were common (70 percent of subjects), but only 10 percent committed new felonies against persons, and 2 percent committed very serious crimes. Youth, frequency of past felonies, and variables such as misbehavior in prison were associated with new offenses. CONCLUSIONS: Whether community mental health treatment affects recidivism cannot be assessed fairly in the absence of higher levels of service during the first months after release. This study also identifies actuarial risk factors that predict new offenses at a level comparable to that of published risk assessment instruments. Commission of less serious offenses that usually precede felonies may provide an early warning of risk for new felonies and an opportunity for strategic intervention. The low rate of serious violence in the community by mentally ill offenders released from prison suggests that the risk of violence may be a weak and potentially counterproductive rationale for community support and mental health treatment of mentally ill offenders.",Lovell D,NLM12364677,Psychiatric Services,recidivism and use of services among persons with mental illness after release from prison.,Oct2002
209,"OBJECTIVE: This study proposed to evaluate Veterans Health Administration (VHA) specialty mental health care workload for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental disorders between 2005 and 2010 in comparison with results from 1997 to 2005. The 2005-2010 time frame represents a period of increased utilization of services by recently returning veterans and of program expansion within VHA. METHODS: VHA administrative databases were queried for all veterans receiving specialty mental health treatment annually between 2005 and 2010. Veterans were categorized by military service era (WWII or Korea, Vietnam, post-Vietnam, Persian Gulf War including operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and peacetime or other), diagnosis (PTSD or a non-PTSD mental disorder), and deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. RESULTS: The total number of veterans served per year increased by 623,326 (117.6%) between 1997 and 2010. Veterans with PTSD increased at a greater rate since 2005 compared with veterans with other mental disorders. Vietnam veterans constituted a majority of all veterans treated for PTSD or for other mental disorders, and the number of Vietnam veterans treated for PTSD continues to grow. The number of visits per veteran with PTSD increased between 2006 and 2010, reversing previous trends. The rate of increase has been highest for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. CONCLUSIONS: Both the number treated and treatment intensity have increased for veterans with PTSD who served in current conflicts, which might be expected, and in the Vietnam era, now 30 years past. A reversal of past declines in treatment intensity coincides with an increase in PTSD treatment funding and program expansion since 2005.

126,"Objective: This study compared sociodemographic characteristics and health conditions of adults with a major depressive episode who received treatment from general medical providers or specialty mental health providers.Methods: The sample included 17,700 respondents ages 18-64 from the 2008-2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health who met the DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode in the past 12 months and of whom 8,900 (61.5%) received treatment for depression.Results: Approximately 21% of adults with a major depressive episode received depression care from general providers only, 19% from specialists only, and 19% from both. Compared with adults receiving care from general providers only, adults who received care from both types of provider were younger, had higher education, were more likely to have suicidal ideation and functional impairment, and were more likely to reside in a county with more psychiatrists providing patient care. These adults, compared with those who received care from a specialty mental health provider only, were more likely to be female, have higher education, have a greater number of general medical comorbidities, and have functional impairment, but they were less likely to be non-Hispanic black or Hispanic.Conclusions: Adults with major depressive episodes who received depression care from both general and specialty providers differed from those who received care from either provider type. Continued efforts to understand differences in depression care in specialty mental health and general medical settings may help improve the provision of mental health services as health care reform continues.","Kuramoto-Crawford, S.

296,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a structured telephone-based care management program for patients in a prepaid health plan receiving new antidepressant prescriptions from psychiatrists. METHODS: Potential participants were identified with computerized medical records and contacted by telephone. Eligible and consenting participants were randomly assigned to continued usual care (N=104) or to a three-session telephone care management program (N=103). Care management contacts included assessment of depressive symptoms, medication adherence, and medication side effects with structured feedback to treating psychiatrists. Effectiveness was assessed three and six months after randomization by blinded telephone assessments (depression scale on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist SCL and patient-rated global improvement). Computerized records were used to assess medication adherence and frequency of in-person follow-up visits. RESULTS: Compared with usual care, the care management intervention had no significant effect on the mean score of the SCL depression scale at six months, on the probability of 50 percent improvement in depressive symptoms (41 percent for care management and 37 percent for usual care), or on the probability of patient-rated improvement (57 percent for care management and 52 percent for usual care). Patients assigned to care management made significantly more medication management visits over six months (2.4 visits compared with 2.0 visits; p=.035), but there were no significant differences in rates of adequate medication treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a low-intensity telephone care management program did not appear to significantly improve clinical outcomes for patients starting antidepressant treatment. Compared with findings from earlier primary care studies, this study found that patients receiving care from a psychiatrist received more intensive treatment, although many still experienced poor outcomes.",Simon GE,NLM17035563,Psychiatric Services,randomized trial of a telephone care management program for outpatients starting antidepressant treatment.,Oct2006

Rates of diagnoses, prescription of psychotropic medications, and total formal psychotherapy sessions received were obtained from insurance claims and electronic medical record databases across all health care settings.Results: Of the 7.5 million patients in the study, 1.2 million (15.6%) received a psychiatric diagnosis in 2011. This varied significantly by race-ethnicity, with Native American/Alaskan Native patients having the highest rates of any diagnosis (20.6%) and Asians having the lowest rates (7.5%). Among patients with a psychiatric diagnosis, 73% (N=850,585) received a psychotropic medication. Non-Hispanic white patients were significantly more likely (77.8%) than other racial-ethnic groups (odds ratio OR range .48-.81) to receive medication. In contrast, only 34% of patients with a psychiatric diagnosis (N=548,837) received formal psychotherapy. Racial-ethnic differences were most pronounced for depression and schizophrenia; compared with whites, non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to receive formal psychotherapy for their depression (OR=1.20) or for their schizophrenia (OR=2.64).Conclusions: There were significant racial-ethnic differences in diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric conditions across 11 U.S. health care systems. Further study is needed to understand underlying causes of these observed differences and whether processes and outcomes of care are equitable across these diverse patient populations.","Coleman, Karen J.",10.1176/appi.ps.201500217,Psychiatric Services,racial-ethnic differences in psychiatric diagnoses and treatment across 11 health care systems in the mental health research network.,Jul2016

267,"OBJECTIVE: Diverting potential arrestees with serious mental illnesses from the criminal justice system to mental health services has become a mainstay of public policy. Federal funding for local diversion and mental health court programs mandates that recipients of funds focus on nonviolent misdemeanants, allowing more serious offenders to proceed through the justice system. This study explored the potential effects of applying such exclusions to a group of arrestees with serious psychiatric illnesses. METHODS: Data on charges in a cohort of mental health service recipients (N=13,816) were analyzed. RESULTS: Episodes of felony arrest, including some involving violence toward others, outnumbered misdemeanors. Under federal funding policies, many such cases would be processed through the justice system. CONCLUSIONS: Expanding inclusion criteria is necessary if diversion is to significantly affect incarceration rates among persons with mental illnesses. Policy makers should heed the accumulating evidence in this area in determining priorities for funding.

89,"Background: Indigenous children living in high income countries have a consistently high prevalence of mental health problems. We aimed to identify psychosocial risk and protective factors for mental health in this setting. Methods: A systematic review of studies published between 1996 and 2016 that quantitatively evaluated the association between psychosocial variables and mental health among Indigenous children living in high income countries was conducted. Psychosocial variables were grouped into commonly occurring domains. Individual studies were judged to provide evidence for an association between a domain and either good mental health, poor mental health, or a negligible or inconsistent association. The overall quality of evidence across all studies for each domain was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines. Results: Forty-seven papers were eligible (mainland US 30 64%, Canada 8 17%, Australia 7 15%, Hawaii 4 9%), including 58,218 participants aged 4-20 years. Most papers were cross-sectional (39, 83%) and measured negative mental health outcomes (41, 87%). Childrens negative cohesion with their families and the presence of adverse events appeared the most reliable predictors of increased negative mental health outcomes. Childrens substance use, experiences of discrimination, comorbid internalising symptoms, and negative parental behaviour also provided evidence of associations with negative mental health outcomes. Positive family and peer relationships, high self-esteem and optimism were associated with increased positive mental health outcomes. Conclusions: Quantitative research investigating Indigenous childrens mental health is largely cross-sectional and focused upon negative outcomes. Indigenous children living in high income countries share many of the same risk and protective factors associated with mental health. The evidence linking childrens familial environment, psychological traits, substance use and experiences of discrimination with mental health outcomes highlights key targets for more concerted efforts to develop initiatives to improve the mental health of Indigenous children.","Young, Christian",10.1186/s12939-017-0652-5,International Journal for Equity in Health,psychosocial factors associated with the mental health of indigenous children living in high income countries: a systematic review.,8/23/2017
111,"Background To estimate the association between exposures to psychosocial risks and risk of minor psychiatric disorder (MPDR) among the working population of Catalonia in 2010, by gender and occupational class. Methods The analysis is based on a sample, corresponding to the year 2010, of workers in Catalonia (n = 2741). We calculated the prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of MPDR, stratifying by occupational class, age and sex, and by the different psychosocial exposures. Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated between MPDR and the different psychosocial exposures using Poisson regression modelling with robust variance estimates. Results The main results show that the prevalence of MPDR was ~12.3% (95% CI: 10.8; 13.8), being higher in women than in men (15.1 and 9.7%, respectively). Workers exposed to each of the various psychosocial dimensions, except for low Control and Double Presence, present significantly higher prevalences of MPDR than non-exposed workers. Differences in terms of gender and occupational class were glimpsed. Conclusion These results highlight the important contribution of psychosocial risk exposures to the MPDR among the working population, and consequently that there is a need to improve workplace psychosocial environments.","Utzet, Mireia",10.1093/pubmed/fdv175,Journal of Public Health,psychosocial exposures and mental health: distribution by gender and occupational class in a population-based study.,Dec2016

351,"Background: Domestic violence and abuse (DVA), defined as threatening behavior or abuse by adults who are intimate partners or family members, is a key public health and clinical priority. The prevalence of DVA in the United Kingdom and worldwide is high, and its impact on physical and mental health is detrimental and persistent. There is currently little support within healthcare settings for women experiencing DVA. Psychological problems in particular may be difficult to manage outside specialist services, as conventional forms of therapy such as counseling that do not address the violence may be ineffective or even harmful. The aim of this study is to assess the overall effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel psychological intervention tailored specifically for survivors of DVA and delivered by domestic violence advocates based in third-sector organizations.Methods and Study Design: This study is an open, pragmatic, parallel group, individually randomized controlled trial. Women ages 16 years and older experiencing domestic violence are being enrolled and randomly allocated to receive usual DVA agency advocacy support (control) or usual DVA agency support plus psychological intervention (intervention). Those in the intervention group will receive eight specialist psychological advocacy (SPA) sessions weekly or fortnightly, with two follow-up sessions, 1 month and then 3 months later. This will be in addition to any advocacy support sessions each woman receives. Women in the control group will receive usual DVA agency support but no additional SPA sessions. The aim is to recruit 250 women to reach the target sample size. The primary outcomes are psychological well-being and depression severity at 1 yr from baseline, as measured by the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. Secondary outcome measures include anxiety, posttraumatic stress, severity and frequency of abuse, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Data from a subsample of women in both groups will contribute to a nested qualitative study with repeat interviews during the year of follow-up.Discussion: This study will contribute to the evidence base for management of the psychological needs of women experiencing DVA. The findings will have important implications for healthcare commissioners and providers, as well as third sector specialist DVA agencies providing services to this client group.Trial Registration: ISRCTN58561170.","Brierley, Gwen",10.1186/1745-6215-14-221,Trials,psychological advocacy toward healing (path): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,2013

362,"Background: For Norwegian general practitioners (GPs), acute treatment of mental illness and substance abuse are among the most commonly experienced emergency situations in out-of-hours primary healthcare. The largest share of acute referrals to emergency psychiatric wards occurs out-of-hours, and out-of-hours services are responsible for a disproportionately high share of compulsory referrals. Concerns exist regarding the quality of mental healthcare provided in the out-of-hours setting. The aim of this study was to explore which challenges GPs experience when providing emergency care out-of-hours to patients presenting problems related to mental illness or substance abuse.Methods: We conducted a qualitative study based on two individual interviews and six focus groups with purposively sampled GPs (totally 45 participants). The interviews were analysed successively in an editing style, using a thematic approach based on methodological descriptions by Charmaz and Malterud.Results: Safety and uncertainty were the dominating themes in the discussions. The threat to personal safety due to unpredictable patient behaviour was a central concern, and present security precautions in the out-of-hours services were questioned. The GPs expressed high levels of uncertainty in their work with patients presenting problems related to mental illness or substance abuse. The complexity of the problems presented, shortage of time, limited access to reliable information and limited range of interventions available during out-of-hours contributed to this uncertainty. Perceived access to second opinion seemed to have a major impact on subjectively experienced work stress.Conclusions: The GPs experienced out-of-hours psychiatry as a field with high levels of uncertainty and limited support to help them meet the experienced challenges. This might influence the quality of care provided. If the current organisation of emergency mental healthcare is to be kept, we need to provide GPs with a better support framework out-of-hours.","Johansen, Ingrid H",10.1186/1472-6963-11-132,BMC Health Services Research,psychiatry out-of-hours: a focus group study of gps experiences in norwegian casualty clinics.,2011

223,"Objective: Population-based studies of prevalence have been used to approximate the amount of need for treatment of mental disorders. This study aimed to estimate need for treatment of alcohol dependence, major depression, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and social phobia.Methods: Psychiatrists used the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) to assess individuals in a probability sample of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area follow-up study for need for and use of mental health services. Population-based estimates were calculated with probability weights.Results: The SCAN sample included 816 participants who were interviewed between 1993 and 1999. Prevalence of need for mental health services in the general population was 28.7%+/-2.7%. Among the disorders studied, the greatest need was for treatment of alcohol dependence; 90% of the SCAN sample who met criteria for this diagnosis, or 13.6%+/-1.9% of the population, needed treatment. In the general population, 10.5%+/-2.1% needed treatment for major depression; 5.2%+/-.9%, for social phobia; 5.2%+/-1.6%, for panic disorder; and 3.2%+/-.9%, for agoraphobia. The highest needs for specific treatment modalities were self-help groups for alcohol dependence, talk therapy for depression, behavior modification for social phobia and agoraphobia, and antidepressant medications for panic disorder. Overall, less than 33% of needs were met. Social phobia and alcohol dependence were the two disorders with the highest proportion of unmet need.Conclusions: Prevalence of mental disorders is only an approximation of the need for treatment. There is a substantial need for mental health services in the general population.

309,"Although previous polio infection remains a considerable cause of long-term morbidity worldwide, few studies have examined the psychiatric consequences of poliomyelitis. The authors followed 4,660 polio patients hospitalized at the primary infectious disease hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark, between 1922 and 1954 as well as 19,017 age- and gender-matched Danes for psychiatric hospitalizations from January 1, 1977, to December 31, 1993. Incidence rates of all psychiatric disorders combined and of separate diagnostic groups of psychiatric diseases in the two cohorts were compared, yielding the incidence rate ratio, a measure of relative risk. Overall, polio patients had a 40% increased risk of being hospitalized for a psychiatric disorder (incidence rate ratio = 1.43, 95% confidence interval: 1.23, 1.66). Apparently, the overall increased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations could not be confined to specific groups of psychiatric disorders but seemed to be explained by slightly increased risks of several different disorders, especially milder psychiatric disorders. Finally, psychiatric morbidity did not differ between paralytic and nonparalytic polio patients. History of hospitalization for polio might be associated with subsequent risk of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders.

201,"OBJECTIVE: In most public mental health systems, assertive community treatment (ACT) is a key service for people with severe mental illness. Although considerable research supports the effectiveness of ACT as an evidence-based practice, other research indicates a failure to adequately implement or sustain ACT, resulting in a diminishing quality of services over time. There have been relatively few attempts to develop and test strategies for implementing new ACT teams and for ensuring their operational and service quality over time. The authors provide a heuristic model for administrators and providers seeking to implement and sustain high-quality ACT programs. METHODS: The authors conducted a selected review of literature about implementation and sustainability of ACT published between January 2000 and May 2011. The review was supplemented by the authors experiences as researchers, administrators, trainers and consultants, and practitioners. RESULTS: A total of 57 articles were found by searches in PsycINFO and PubMed. The authors propose four major approaches for assessing and ensuring the quality of ACT programs-policy and administrative, training and consultation, team operational, and program evaluation-and identify strategies for achieving the goals in each category. CONCLUSIONS: Although a scarcity of rigorous research makes firm conclusions difficult, the authors conclude that no single strategy is sufficient for ensuring adequate ACT implementation and services of consistently good quality. Rather, it is useful to implement a blend of policy and administrative, training and consultation, team operational, and program evaluation strategies. Additional rigorous research on implementing and sustaining the quality of ACT and other evidence-based practices is needed.

METHOD: Therapists for 36 patients who died by suicide while in treatment filled out clinical, medication, and psychological questionnaires and wrote detailed case narratives. They then presented their cases at an all-day workshop, and critical problems were identified in the cases. RESULTS: Six recurrent problem areas were identified: poor communication with another therapist involved in the case, permitting patients or relatives to control the therapy, avoidance of issues related to sexuality, ineffective or coercive actions resulting from the therapists anxieties about a patients potential suicide, not recognizing the meaning of the patients communications, and untreated or undertreated symptoms.

METHODS: Clinical outcomes were compared for patients who were randomly assigned to integrated care or enhanced specialty referral. Integrated care consisted of mental health services co-located in primary care in collaboration with primary care physicians. Enhanced specialty referral consisted of referral to physically separate, clearly identified mental health or substance abuse clinics. RESULTS: A total of 1,531 patients were included; their mean age was 73.9 years. Remission rates and symptom reduction for all depressive disorders were similar for the two models at the three- and six-month follow-ups. For the subgroup with major depression, the enhanced specialty referral model was associated with a greater reduction in depression severity than integrated care, but rates of remission and change in function did not differ across models of care for major depression. CONCLUSIONS: Six-month outcomes were comparable for the two models.

Multivariable regression analyses were conducted at the facility level and assessed associations between PCMHI staffing ratios and the following indicators of depression treatment in the three months following a new episode of depression: any antidepressant receipt, adequacy of antidepressant receipt, any psychotherapy receipt, and psychotherapy engagement (three or more visits).Results: Higher facility PCMHI staffing ratios were associated with a greater percentage of patients who received any psychotherapy treatment (B=1.16, p<.01) and who engaged in psychotherapy (B=.39, p<.01). When analyses controlled for total PCMHI staffing, the proportion of social workers as part of PCMHI was positively correlated with the percentage of patients with adequate antidepressant treatment continuation (B=3.16, p=.03). The proportion of nurses in PCMHI was negatively associated with the percentage of patients with engagement in psychotherapy (B=-2.83, p=.02).Conclusions: PCMHI programs with greater overall staffing ratios demonstrated better performance on indicators of psychotherapy for depression but not on indicators of antidepressant treatment. Further investigation is needed to determine whether differences in discipline-specific staffing play a causal role in driving associated differences in receipt of treatment.","Levine, Debra S.",10.1176/appi.ps.201600186,Psychiatric Services,primary care-mental health integration in the va health system: associations between provider staffing and quality of depression care.,May2017

73,"Background: Young people who have social disability associated with severe and complex mental health problems are an important group in need of early intervention. Their problems often date back to childhood and become chronic at an early age. Without intervention, the long-term prognosis is often poor and the economic costs very large. There is a major gap in the provision of evidence-based interventions for this group, and therefore new approaches to detection and intervention are needed. This trial provides a definitive evaluation of a new approach to early intervention with young people with social disability and severe and complex mental health problems using social recovery therapy (SRT) over a period of 9 months to improve mental health and social recovery outcomes.Methods: This is a pragmatic, multi-centre, single blind, superiority randomised controlled trial. It is conducted in three sites in the UK: Sussex, Manchester and East Anglia. Participants are aged 16 to 25 and have both persistent and severe social disability (defined as engaged in less than 30 hours per week of structured activity) and severe and complex mental health problems. The target sample size is 270 participants, providing 135 participants in each trial arm. Participants are randomised 1:1 using a web-based randomisation system and allocated to either SRT plus optimised treatment as usual (enhanced standard care) or enhanced standard care alone. The primary outcome is time use, namely hours spent in structured activity per week at 15 months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes assess typical mental health problems of the group, including subthreshold psychotic symptoms, negative symptoms, depression and anxiety. Time use, secondary outcomes and health economic measures are assessed at 9, 15 and 24 months post-randomisation.Discussion: This definitive trial will be the first to evaluate a novel psychological treatment for social disability and mental health problems in young people presenting with social disability and severe and complex non-psychotic mental health problems. The results will have important implications for policy and practice in the detection and early intervention for this group in mental health services.Trial Registration: Trial Registry: International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Registry.Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN47998710 (registered 29/11/2012).","Fowler, David",10.1186/s13063-017-2062-9,Trials,prevention and treatment of long-term social disability amongst young people with emerging severe mental illness with social recovery therapy (the prodigy trial): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,7/11/2017

Independent variables were measured at T0 and subjective quality of life (SQOL) at T2.Results: Analysis yielded four classes. SQOL at T2 was higher than the mean in Class 4 (""Older, poorly educated single men living in supervised housing, with psychotic disorders but with few serious needs, receiving substantial help from services"") and lower than the mean in Class 2 (""Young females with serious needs and co-occurring mental and addiction disorders living in independent apartments"").Conclusion: Given that predictive SQOL varies in relation to combinations of associated variables, it would be useful for treatments or service programs to target specific predictors to the different profiles.","Fleury, Marie-Josée",10.1186/s12955-015-0346-x,Health & Quality of Life Outcomes,predictive typology of subjective quality of life among participants with severe mental disorders after a five-year follow-up: a longitudinal two-step cluster analysis.,9/22/2015

Over half (54%) of the participants with PTSD had two or more types of comorbid disorders--that is, affective, anxiety, behavioral, or substance use disorders--and 11% had all four types of comorbid disorders. Among males, having any psychiatric diagnosis significantly increased the odds of having comorbid PTSD. Among females, alcohol use disorder and both alcohol and drug use disorders significantly increased the odds of having PTSD. No significant difference in prevalence rates of PTSD was found between males and females with specific psychiatric disorders. The prevalence of any comorbid psychiatric disorder was significantly greater for males with PTSD than that for females with PTSD (OR=3.4, CI=1.1-10.6, p<.05).Conclusions: Detection of comorbid PTSD among detained youths must be improved. PTSD is often missed because traumatic experiences are rarely included in standard screens or volunteered by patients.

Little is known regarding mental health status and treatment use in this population. This study provided national estimates of the prevalence of persistent depression and anxiety, as well as estimates of illness severity, treatment use, and quality of care in this population.Methods: Data were from a prospective, community-based cohort study of 1,642 adults with probable major depression, dysthymia, panic disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder who were part of a U.S. probability sample. Telephone surveys were conducted during 1997-1998 and again an average of 32 months later. Surveys assessed diagnosis, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, medical conditions, suicidal ideation, insurance, medications, and treatment use.Results: At follow-up, 59% no longer met criteria for a disorder. The estimated national prevalence of a persistent depressive or anxiety disorder was 4.7%. In this subgroup, 87% had a chronic comorbid medical disorder. During the past year, 88% had seen a primary care practitioner, and 22% had seen a mental health specialist. Between baseline and follow-up, the percentage using appropriate medication increased (21% to 29%), but there was no significant change in use of appropriate counseling (23% to 19%). Only 12% were receiving both appropriate medication and counseling at follow-up. Treatment was less likely for men and people with less education. Suicidal ideation was present in 51% at follow-up.Conclusions: Strategies are needed to increase treatment use and intensity for people with persistent depressive and anxiety disorders. This may require improved access to mental health specialists.",Young AS,10.1176/appi.ps.59.12.1391,Psychiatric Services,persistent depression and anxiety in the united states: prevalence and quality of care.,Dec2008

142,"Objective: Various forms of compulsory psychiatric community treatment orders (CTOs) are commonly utilized internationally. CTOs remain contentious because of the ethical implications of coercing patients to receive treatment. Understanding patients experience of CTOs can assist in the development of more patient-centered and recovery-focused community care. This review examined the relationship between CTOs and patients perceptions of coercion in the literature.Methods: A search of key terms relating to CTOs and patients perceptions of coercion was conducted of relevant databases from their inception to March 31, 2014. Publications were included if they were peer reviewed, reported on original research, surveyed or interviewed patients who were or had been subject to a CTO, and were written in English. Factors influencing patients perceptions of coercion, including the regional context of the studies, were identified.Results: Twenty-three primary research articles, reporting on 14 studies from seven countries, were included. Evidence indicated that CTOs may contribute to a patients sense of coercion, with marked variations among studies in the levels of coercion. Contextual factors, including perceptions of alternatives to CTOs, the presence of additional forms of leverage in patients lives, and the process of CTO initiation and enforcement, may mitigate or enhance perceptions of coercion.Conclusions: Coercive elements of CTOs may be reduced through increased patient access to information, better working relationships with service providers, and accessible, fair processes. The coercive aspects of CTOs should be seen as part of a broader understanding of the daily pressures and leverage applied in outpatient psychiatric treatment.","Francombe Pridham, Katherine M.",10.1176/appi.ps.201400538,Psychiatric Services,perception of coercion among patients with a psychiatric community treatment order: a literature review.,Jan2016

This study examined the effects of payeeship and perceived financial leverage on positive and negative dimensions of the client-provider relationship.Methods: The sample consisted of 205 adults ages 18 to 65 with axis I disorders who were receiving mental health services from a large urban community mental health clinic. Information about money management characteristics and ratings of the client-provider relationship were collected via face-to-face interview.Results: Fifty-three percent of the sample had a payee or money manager, and 79% of this group had a clinician payee. Respondents with co-occurring psychotic and substance use disorders, lower functioning, and lower insight about their illness were more likely to have a clinician payee. Forty percent of those with a clinician payee reported perceived financial leverage. Having a clinician payee was also associated with perceived financial leverage and with higher levels of conflict in the case management relationship. When examined in combination, financial leverage was found to mediate the effects of payeeship on conflict in the case management relationship (mean+/-SE=2.37+/-1.33, 95% confidence interval=16-5.52, p<.05). That is, payeeship appeared to increase conflict in the therapeutic alliance when used as a source of treatment leverage.Conclusions: Although payeeship provides important support and may enhance functional outcomes for the patient, decisions about using the mechanism for promoting treatment adherence should take into account the potential disruption to the client-provider relationship.",Angell B,NLM17325110,Psychiatric Services,"payeeship, financial leverage, and the client-provider relationship.",Mar2007

METHODS: Data were collected for 587 psychiatrists who participated in the American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Educations Practice Research Network 1999 Study of Psychiatric Patients and Treatments, which generated nationally representative data for 1,589 adult patients. RESULTS: Findings indicate that more than 66 percent of patients of psychiatrists received some form of psychotherapy from the psychiatrist or another provider in the past 30 days--56 percent from their psychiatrist and 10 percent from another clinician. Although 72 percent of patients with depression received psychotherapy, more than half of those with schizophrenia did not. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients of psychiatrists received psychotherapy from their psychiatrist. However, these rates varied by demographic, diagnostic, and health plan characteristics and by practice setting.

317,"Objective: Patients experiences and satisfaction ratings are increasingly used to evaluate quality of care. This study assessed the extent to which outpatient teams, clinics, and health trusts contributed to patients experiences and to what extent clinicians evaluations of quality were related to patients experiences.Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to 15,422 outpatients who attended Norwegian clinics in September 2004; 43% responded. Patients experiences were measured on an 11-item index and three subscales: outcomes, interaction with clinicians, and information. Aggregated responses from clinicians were linked to the data on patients experiences. Multilevel analyses were used to divide the variance between the different organizational levels and to assess the relationship with clinicians opinions and individual-level factors.Results: Data were analyzed for 6,570 outpatients within 222 teams derived from 89 outpatient clinics within 33 health trusts. Differences in patients scores were determined largely at the patient level, with teams accounting for 2% of the total variance and organizational levels of clinics and health trusts not contributing to patients experiences. Team-level clinician quality scores were not significantly associated with patients experiences. Better experiences were significantly associated with patients female gender, older age, better self-perceived health, absence of an inpatient history, longer treatment episodes, frequent consultations, and waiting times perceived as acceptable.Conclusions: The organizational contributions to patients experience scores were minimal. Although clinicians ratings of quality are not a substitute for patients perceptions of quality, surveys of outpatients experiences and satisfaction may not be appropriate for cross-sectional comparisons of health care providers.",Bjørngaard JH,NLM17664522,Psychiatric Services,patients experiences and clinicians ratings of the quality of outpatient teams in psychiatric care units in norway.,Aug2007

There is little information about negative effects of psychological interventions.Aims: To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for perceived negative effects of psychological treatment for common mental disorders.Method: Cross-sectional survey of people receiving psychological treatment from 184 services in England and Wales. Respondents were asked whether they had experienced lasting bad effects from the treatment they received.Results: Of 14 587 respondents, 763 (5.2%) reported experiencing lasting bad effects. People aged over 65 were less likely to report such effects and sexual and ethnic minorities were more likely to report them. People who were unsure what type of therapy they received were more likely to report negative effects (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% CI 1.22-1.87), and those that stated that they were given enough information about therapy before it started were less likely to report them (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.54-0.79).Conclusions: One in 20 people responding to this survey reported lasting bad effects from psychological treatment.

All 880 adult patients in the EDEN study who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia, mood disorders, neurotic disorders, and behavioral syndromes (ICD-10 codes F20-F59) and complete data on baseline variables were included. Outcomes were symptom levels (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), subjective quality of life (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life), and social disability (Groningen Social Disabilities Schedule) assessed at discharge and at three and 12 months postdischarge. Mixed- and main-effects models of interaction effects between patient characteristics and outcomes were generated.Results: Patients age, diagnostic category, and living status (alone or not) did not predict differences in outcomes between the two settings. However, patients with higher symptom levels at baseline experienced greater symptom improvements after treatment on a ward, and those with more years of education had greater symptom improvements after day hospital treatment. Female patients had more favorable social disability outcomes after day hospital treatment, but no difference between the two settings was found for male patients.Conclusions: More severe symptoms may be a reason for admission to acute treatment on a conventional ward rather than a day hospital. Female patients and those with more education may benefit more from acute treatment in day hospitals.",Priebe S,10.1176/ps.62.3.pss6203_0278,Psychiatric Services,patient characteristics predicting better treatment outcomes in day hospitals compared with inpatient wards.,Mar2011
327,"OBJECTIVE: For a proposed Medicare prospective payment system for inpatient psychiatric facility treatment, the authors developed a casemix classification to capture differences in patients? real daily resource use. METHOD: Primary data on patient characteristics and daily time spent in various activities were collected in a survey of 696 patients from 40 inpatient psychiatric facilities. Survey data were combined with Medicare claims data to estimate intensity-adjusted daily cost. Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis of average daily routine and ancillary costs yielded several hierarchical classification groupings. Regression analysis was used to control for facility and day-of-stay effects in order to compare hierarchical models with models based on the recently proposed payment system of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. RESULTS: CART analysis identified a small set of patient characteristics strongly associated with higher daily costs, including age, psychiatric diagnosis, deficits in daily living activities, and detox or ECT use. A parsimonious, 16-group, fully interactive model that used five major DSM-IV categories and stratified by age, illness severity, deficits in daily living activities, dangerousness, and use of ECT explained 40% (out of a possible 76%) of daily cost variation not attributable to idiosyncratic daily changes within patients. A noninteractive model based on diagnosis-related groups, age, and medical comorbidity had explanatory power of only 32%. CONCLUSIONS: A regression model with 16 casemix groups restricted to using appropriate payment variables (i.e., those with clinical face validity and low administrative burden that are easily validated and provide proper care incentives) produced more efficient and equitable payments than did a noninteractive system based on diagnosis-related groups.",Drozd EM,NLM16585450,American Journal of Psychiatry,patient casemix classification for medicare psychiatric prospective payment.,Apr2006

376,"Background: Because numerous studies have revealed the negative consequences of stigmatisation, this study explores the determinants of stigma experiences. In particular, it examines whether or not part-time hospitalisation in contemporary psychiatric hospitals is associated with less stigma experiences than full-time hospitalisation. Methods: Survey data on 378 clients of 42 wards from 8 psychiatric hospitals are used to compare full-time clients, part-time clients and clients receiving part-time care as aftercare on three dimensions of stigma experiences, while controlling for symptoms, diagnosis and clients background characteristics. Results: The results reveal that part-time clients without previous full-time hospitalisation report less social rejection than clients who receive full-time hospitalisation. In contrast, clients receiving part-time treatment as aftercare do not differ significantly from full-time clients concerning social rejection. No significant results for the other stigma dimensions were found. Conclusion: Concerning social rejection, immediate part-time hospitalisation could be recommended as a means of destigmatisation for clients of contemporary psychiatric hospitals.",Verhaeghe M,NLM18544154,BMC Health Services Research,part-time hospitalisation and stigma experiences: a study in contemporary psychiatric hospitals.,2008

After baseline interview, consenting participants were randomly assigned to the nine-week ESS intervention or a minimally enhanced treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants were assessed by using symptom, psychosocial functioning, and self-stigma measures at baseline, postintervention, and six-month follow-up. Demographic characteristics were assessed at baseline.Results: Compared with participants in the control condition, ESS group participants showed significant decreases on the stereotype agreement and self-concurrence subscales of the Self Stigma of Mental Illness Scale, significant improvement on the alienation and stigma resistance subscales of the Internalized Stigma Mental Illness measure, and a significant increase in recovery orientation from baseline to postintervention. None of these differences were sustained at six-month follow-up.Conclusions: Results indicate that ESS was useful in helping to reduce key aspects of internalized stigma among individuals with mental illnesses and that advances in the delivery, targeting, and content of the intervention in the field may be warranted to increase its potency.","Lucksted, Alicia",10.1176/appi.ps.201600037,Psychiatric Services,outcomes of a psychoeducational intervention to reduce internalized stigma among psychosocial rehabilitation clients.,Apr2017

Illness severity was assessed by the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) and social functioning by the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). On the HoNOS, 33% of patients showed reliable change. On the SOFAS, 27% showed reliable change, although the change was substantial for few patients. Over time, patients showed moderate but significant improvements on the HoNOS and SOFAS. The HoNOS subscales concerning interpersonal relationships and social inclusion showed significant change. Very isolated people with mental illness gained some advantages from this rehabilitation program that was based on a close relationship with a key worker; however, the program duration may have been inadequate to produce substantial changes.

113,"Objective: This study aimed to determine whether a self-management support service was more effective than treatment as usual in reducing depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes and increasing personal recovery among individuals with chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms.Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial of a self-management support service consisting of depression self-management training, recovery coaching, and care coordination. The 18-month intervention included regular telephone or in-person contacts with a care manager and a structured group program co-led by a professional therapist and a trained peer specialist. Intervention (N=150) and control (N=152) participants ages ? 18 with chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms were recruited from five clinics in Seattle, Washington. Outcome measures included the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression scale, the Recovery Assessment Scale, the Patient-Rated Global Improvement scale, and the percentage of participants with a major depressive episode. Interviewers were masked to treatment condition.Results: Repeated-measures estimates of the long-term effect of the intervention versus usual care (average of the six-, 12-, and 18-month outcomes adjusted for age, gender, and site) indicated that intervention participants had less severe symptoms (p=.002) and higher recovery scores (p=.03), were less likely to be depressed (odds ratio OR=.52, p=.001), and were more likely to be much improved (OR=1.96, p=.001).Conclusions: These findings support providing regular outreach care management and a self-care group offering a combined behavioral and recovery-oriented approach for people with chronic or recurrent depressive symptoms.","Ludman, Evette J.",10.1176/appi.ps.201400295,Psychiatric Services,organized self-management support services for chronic depressive symptoms: a randomized controlled trial.,Jan2016

149,"Objective: Repeated hospitalizations and arrests or incarcerations diminish the ability of individuals with serious mental illnesses to pursue recovery. Community mental health systems need new models to address recidivism as well as service fragmentation, lack of engagement by local stakeholders, and poor communication between mental health providers and the police. This study examined the initial effects on institutional recidivism and measures of recovery among persons enrolled in Opening Doors to Recovery, an intensive, team-based community support program for persons with mental illness and a history of inpatient psychiatric recidivism. A randomized controlled trial of the model is underway.Methods: The number of hospitalizations, days hospitalized, and arrests (all from state administrative sources) in the year before enrollment and during the first 12 months of enrollment in the program were compared. Longitudinal trajectories of recovery-using three self-report and five clinician-rated measures-were examined. Analyses accounted for baseline symptom severity and intensity of involvement in the program.Results: One hundred participants were enrolled, and 72 were included in the analyses. Hospitalizations decreased, from 1.9±1.6 to .6±.9 (p<.001), as did hospital days, from 27.6±36.4 to 14.9±41.3 (p<.001), although number of arrests (which are rare events) did not. Significant linear trends were observed for recovery measures, and trajectories of improvement were apparent across the entire follow-up period.Conclusions: Opening Doors to Recovery holds promise as a new service approach for reducing hospital recidivism and promoting recovery in community mental health systems and is deserving of further controlled testing.","Compton, Michael T.",10.1176/appi.ps.201300482,Psychiatric Services,opening doors to recovery: recidivism and recovery among persons with serious mental illnesses and repeated hospitalizations.,Feb2016

The results found no gender difference in the likely intentions to seek online help though year level was significant and students experiencing psychological distress had a preference for online counselling.

77,"Objective: A random-effects meta-analysis of studies that used Markov transition probabilities (TPs) to describe outcomes for mental health service systems of differing quality for persons with serious mental illness was implemented to improve the scientific understanding of systems performance, to use in planning simulations to project service system costs and outcomes over time, and to test a theory of how outcomes for systems varying in quality differ.Methods: Nineteen systems described in 12 studies were coded as basic (B), maintenance (M), and recovery oriented (R) on the basis of descriptions of services provided. TPs for studies were aligned with a common functional-level framework, converted to a one-month time period, synthesized, and compared with theory-based expectations. Meta-regression was employed to explore associations between TPs and characteristics of service recipients and studies.Results: R systems performed better than M and B systems. However, M systems did not perform better than B systems. All systems showed negative as well as positive TPs. For approximately one-third of synthesized TPs, substantial interstudy heterogeneity was noted. Associations were found between TPs and service recipient and study variables Conclusions: Conceptualizing systems as B, M, and R has potential for improving scientific understanding and systems planning. R systems appear more effective than B and M systems, although there is no ""magic bullet"" system for all service recipients. Interstudy heterogeneity indicates need for common approaches to reporting service recipient states, time periods for TPs, service recipient attributes, and service system characteristics. TPs found should be used in Markov simulations to project system effectiveness and costs of over time.","Leff, Hugh Stephen",10.1176/appi.ps.201500523,Psychiatric Services,no magic bullet: a theory-based meta-analysis of markov transition probabilities in studies of service systems for persons with mental disabilities.,Mar2017

369,"Background: Recent years have seen a number of attempts to reduce the stigma related to mental illness; the media can play a significant role in perpetuating this stigma. This paper analyses trends in newspaper coverage of mental illness in the UK between 1992-2008 across a range of psychiatric diagnoses. Methods: A content analysis was performed on a sample of articles (n = 1361) about mental illness in a range of UK newspapers in 1992, 2000, and 2008. Results: There was a significant proportional reduction in negative articles about mental illness between 1992 and 2008, and a significant increase in articles explaining psychiatric disorders. Coverage improved for depression but remained largely negative for schizophrenia. Conclusions: Newspaper coverage of mental illness became less stigmatising overall in the 1990s and 2000s, but this was not true for all diagnoses.","Goulden, Robert",10.1186/1471-2458-11-796,BMC Public Health,"newspaper coverage of mental illness in the uk, 1992-2008.",2011
83,"Objective: The not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (NCRMD) designation remains widely misunderstood by the public. Such misunderstandings may also be reflected in the media. As such, the aim of this study is to conduct a preliminary examination of the tone and content of recent Canadian newspaper articles where NCRMD is a major theme, comparing these to generic articles about mental illness.Methods: Articles about mental illness were gathered from major Canadian newspapers. These were then divided into two categories: 1) articles where NCRMD was a major theme and 2) articles where NCRMD was not a major theme. Articles were then coded for the presence or absence of 1) a negative tone, 2) stigmatising tone/content, 3) recovery/rehabilitation as a theme, and 4) shortage of resources/poor quality of care as a theme.Results: The retrieval strategy resulted in 940 articles. Fourteen percent ( n = 131) of all articles had NCRMD as a major theme. In comparison to generic articles about mental illness, articles with NCRMD as a major theme were significantly more likely to have a negative tone ( P < 0.001) and stigmatising tone/content ( P < 0.001) and significantly less likely to have recovery/rehabilitation ( P < 0.001) or shortage of resources/poor quality of care as a theme ( P < 0.001).Conclusions: Articles with NCRMD as a theme were overwhelmingly negative and almost never focused on recovery or rehabilitation, in stark comparison to generic articles about mental illness.","Whitley, Rob",10.1177/0706743717720688,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,newspaper articles related to the not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (ncrmd) designation: a comparative analysis.,Oct2017

199,"Neuroimaging research has substantiated the functional and structural abnormalities underlying psychiatric disorders but has, thus far, failed to have a significant impact on clinical practice. Recently, neuroimaging-based diagnoses and clinical predictions derived from machine learning analysis have shown significant potential for clinical translation. This review introduces the key concepts of this approach, including how the multivariate integration of patterns of brain abnormalities is a crucial component. We survey recent findings that have potential application for diagnosis, in particular early and differential diagnoses in Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia, and the prediction of clinical response to treatment in depression. We discuss the specific clinical opportunities and the challenges for developing biomarkers for psychiatry in the absence of a diagnostic gold standard. We propose that longitudinal outcomes, such as early diagnosis and prediction of treatment response, offer definite opportunities for progress. We propose that efforts should be directed toward clinically challenging predictions in which neuroimaging may have added value, compared with the existing standard assessment. We conclude that diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers will be developed through the joint application of expert psychiatric knowledge in addition to advanced methods of analysis.","Fu, Cynthia H Y",NLM24099497,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,neuroimaging-based biomarkers in psychiatry: clinical opportunities of a paradigm shift.,Sep2013

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess mental health symptoms, utilization of mental health services, and perceived barriers to service use among National Guard members and their significant others (including spouses and others with whom they share a committed relationship) from a Midwestern state.Methods: Participants were recruited for the study at military-sponsored reintegration workshops, which took place 45-90 days after service members return from deployment. A sample of 332 National Guard members and 212 significant others volunteered to complete a survey that assessed mental health symptoms, service utilization, and barriers to treatment.Results: Forty percent of National Guard members and 34% of significant others met the screening criteria for one or more mental health problems. Of those meeting the criteria, 53% reported seeking help of some kind (50% of soldiers; 61% of significant others). Stigma associated with mental health care and concerns about service utilization appearing on military records ranked high as barriers among service members. Concerns about the influence of mental health issues on career advancement were of note. For significant others, barriers included the costs of mental health care, trouble with scheduling appointments, difficulty in getting time off work, and not knowing where to get help.Conclusions: The mental health effects of combat on the soldier and his or her significant other remain a challenge for National Guard families, who often reside in communities that show little understanding of the psychological costs of war. Barriers remain for mental health service utilization.","Gorman, Lisa A",10.1176/ps.62.1.pss6201_0028,Psychiatric Services,"national guard families after combat: mental health, use of mental health services, and perceived treatment barriers.",Jan2011

Research suggests that MI is efficacious in improving substance use in adolescents. Research has been slower to emerge in other behaviours, but available randomized controlled trials suggest that MI has great promise for improving mental and physical health outcomes in this developmental period. The relational and technical components of MI are highly relevant for the adolescent developmental period, and studies have shown that these components are related to outcomes in this population. There are several ways to include MI in clinical interventions for adolescents, ranging from MI in brief settings to using MI as a platform from which all other treatments are offered. Future research is necessary to test the effects of MI in adolescent group settings and the full integration of MI into other adolescent treatment approaches.",Naar-King S,NLM22114919,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,motivational interviewing in adolescent treatment.,Nov2011

79,"Rapid growth and development in recent decades has seen mental health and mental illness emerge as priority health concerns for the Gulf Cooperation Council (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). As a result, mental health services in the region are being redefined and expanded. However, there is a paucity of local research to guide ongoing service development. Local research is important because service users experience of mental illness and mental health services are linked to their sociocultural context. In order for service development to be most effective, there is a need for increased understanding of the people who use these services.This article aims to review and synthesize mental health research from the Gulf Cooperation Council. It also seeks to identify gaps in the literature and suggest directions for future research. A scoping framework was used to conduct this review. To identify studies, database searches were undertaken, regional journals were hand-searched, and reference lists of included articles were examined. Empirical studies undertaken in the Gulf Cooperation Council that reported mental health service users experience of mental illness were included. Framework analysis was used to synthesize results. Fifty-five studies met inclusion criteria and the following themes were identified: service preferences, illness (symptomology, perceived cause, impact), and recovery (traditional healing, family support, religion). Gaps included contradictory findings related to the supportive role of the Arabic extended family and religion, under-representation of women in study samples, and limited attention on illness management outside of the hospital setting.From this review, it is clear that the sociocultural context in the region is linked to service users experience of mental illness. Future research that aims to fill the identified gaps and develop and test culturally appropriate interventions will aid practice and policy development in the region.","Hickey, Jason E.",10.1186/s12961-016-0123-2,Health Research Policy & Systems,mental illness research in the gulf cooperation council: a scoping review.,8/4/2016
190,"During the past century, the scope of mental health intervention in North America has gradually expanded from an initial focus on hospitalized patients with psychoses to outpatients with neurotic disorders, including the so-called worried well. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fifth Edition, is further embracing the concept of a mental illness spectrum, such that increasing attention to the softer end of the continuum can be expected in the future. This anticipated shift rekindles important questions about how mental illness is defined, how to distinguish between mental disorders and normal reactions, whether psychiatry is guilty of prevalence inflation, and when somatic therapies should be used to treat problems of living. Such debates are aptly illustrated by the example of complicated bereavement, which is best characterized as a form of adjustment disorder. Achieving an overarching definition of mental illness is challenging, owing to the many different contexts in which DSM diagnoses are used. Careful analyses of such contextual utility must inform future decisions about what ends up in DSM, as well as how mental illness is defined by public health policy and society at large. A viable vision for the future of psychiatry should include a spectrum model of mental health (as opposed to exclusively mental illness) that incorporates graded, evidence-based interventions delivered by a range of providers at each point along its continuum.",Pierre JM,NLM23149280,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,mental illness and mental health: is the glass half empty or half full?,Nov2012

76,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the magnitude of mental health problems, particularly life-threatening ones, experienced by transgender and/or gender nonconforming (TGNC) youth can lead to improved management of these conditions. METHODS: Electronic medical records were used to identify a cohort of 588 transfeminine and 745 transmasculine children (3-9 years old) and adolescents (10-17 years old) enrolled in integrated health care systems in California and Georgia. Ten male and 10 female referent cisgender enrollees were matched to each TGNC individual on year of birth, race and/ or ethnicity, study site, and membership year of the index date (first evidence of gender nonconforming status). Prevalence ratios were calculated by dividing the proportion of TGNC individuals with a specific mental health diagnosis or diagnostic category by the corresponding proportion in each reference group by transfeminine and/or transmasculine status, age group, and time period before the index date. RESULTS: Common diagnoses for children and adolescents were attention deficit disorders (transfeminine 15%; transmasculine 16%) and depressive disorders (transfeminine 49%; transmasculine 62%), respectively. For all diagnostic categories, prevalence was severalfold higher among TGNC youth than in matched reference groups. Prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals CIs) for history of self-inflicted injury in adolescents 6 months before the index date ranged from 18 (95% CI 4.4-82) to 144 (95% CI 36-1248). The corresponding range for suicidal ideation was 25 (95% CI 14 - 45) to 54 (95% CI 18-218). CONCLUSIONS: TGNC youth may present with mental health conditions requiring immediate evaluation and implementation of clinical, social, and educational gender identity support measures.","Becerra-Culqui, Tracy A.",10.1542/peds.2017-3845,Pediatrics,mental health of transgender and gender nonconforming youth compared with their peers.,May2018
150,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for psychiatric disorders among extremely low birth weight (ELBW) survivors in their early to mid-30s and to determine whether those born small for gestational age or those exposed to a full course of antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) were at particularly high risk. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal, population-based cohort of 84 ELBW survivors and 90 normal birth weight (NBW) control participants born in Ontario, Canada from 1977 to 1982 were assessed by interviewers naive to birth weight status using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. RESULTS: ELBW survivors had lower odds of an alcohol or substance use disorder but higher odds of current non-substance-related psychiatric problems (odds ratio OR = 2.47; 95% confidence interval CI, 1.19-5.14). Those born ELBW and SGA exhibited the same patterns with larger effects. ACS-exposed ELBW survivors had even higher odds of any current non-substance-related psychiatric disorder (OR = 4.41; 95% CI, 1.65-11.82), particularly generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 3.42; 95% CI, 1.06-11.06), the generalized type of social phobia (OR = 5.80; 95% CI, 1.20-27.99), and the inattentive subtype of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR = 11.45; 95% CI, 2.06-63.50). CONCLUSIONS: In their early to mid-30s, ELBW survivors were less likely to have alcohol or substance use disorders but may be at greater risk for other psychiatric problems. Those exposed to ACS were at especially high risk and manifested no reduction in alcohol or substance use disorders. ELBW survivors exposed to ACS may be a special group at risk for psychopathology in adulthood.","Van Lieshout, Ryan J.",10.1542/peds.2014-3143,Pediatrics,mental health of extremely low birth weight survivors in their 30s.,Mar2015
366,"Background: Mental ill health is a common condition in the general population, yet only about half of those with a mental disorder have treatment contact. Personal experience may affect attitudes, which in turn influence the help-seeking process. This study investigated differences in mental health literacy and attitudes among mentally healthy persons and in persons with symptoms of mental illness with and without treatment contact. Method: A postal screening questionnaire was sent to a random sample of the general population aged 20-64 in the county of Skaraborg, Sweden in order to ascertain mental health status and history of treatment contact; 3538 responded (49%). Face-to-face interviews were carried out in random sub samples of mentally healthy persons (n = 128) and in mentally ill persons with (n = 125) and without (n = 105) mental health care contact. Mental health literacy and attitudes to treatment were assessed using questions based on a vignette depicting a person with depression. Past month mental disorder was diagnosed according to the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN). Results: Two thirds failed to recognize depression in a vignette; recognition was equally poor in mentally healthy persons and in persons with symptoms of mental illness with and without treatment contact. In response to an open-ended question concerning appropriate interventions, one third suggested counselling and only one percent proposed antidepressant treatment. Again, proportions were similar in all groups. Persons with a history of mental health contact more often suggested that a GP would provide the best form of help. When presented with a list of possible interventions, those with a history of mental health contact were more positive to medical interventions such as antidepressants, hypnotics, and inpatient psychiatric treatment. When asked about the prognosis for the condition described in the vignette, persons with treatment contact were less likely to believe in full recovery without intervention; mentally ill without treatment contact were more optimistic. Conclusion: Mental health literacy, specially concerning attitudes towards interventions is associated with personal history of mental health care.",Dahlberg KM,NLM18184424,BMC Public Health,mental health literacy and attitudes in a swedish community sample - investigating the role of personal experience of mental health care.,2008

135,"OBJECTIVE Mandated community treatment has been proposed as a mechanism to engage people with severe and persistent mental disorders in treatment. Recently, two approaches to mandate treatment through the courts have been highlighted: assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) and mental health court programs. This study examined levels of perceived coercion, procedural justice, and the impact of the program (mental health court or AOT) among participants in a community treatment system. METHODS Data were analyzed from interviews with former AOT participants who were no longer under court supervision (N=17) and with graduates of a mental health court program (N=35). The MacArthur Admission Experience Survey, created to measure perceived coercion, procedural justice, and program impact on hospital admission, was modified to include judges and case managers. RESULTS Mental health court graduates perceived significantly less coercion and more procedural justice in their interactions with the judge than did AOT participants. No significant difference was found between mental health court and AOT participants in perceptions of procedural justice in interactions with their case managers. Mental health court participants felt more respected and had more positive feelings about the program than did AOT participants. CONCLUSIONS Both mental health courts and AOT programs have potentially coercive aspects. Findings suggest that judges and case managers can affect participants perceptions of these programs by the degree to which they demonstrate procedural justice, a process that may affect the long-term effects of the programs on individuals.","Munetz, Mark R",10.1176/appi.ps.002642012,Psychiatric Services,"mental health court and assisted outpatient treatment: perceived coercion, procedural justice, and program impact.",Mar2014

166,"Objective: Jail diversion programs strive to divert offenders with mental illness from prosecution and into mental health treatment. Participants sometimes spend a short time in jail after arraignment, either because treatment resources are not immediately available or because judges want to increase their motivation for treatment. This study explored the effects of short jail stays before jail diversion (""jail first"") on participants postdiversion service use and reoffending.Methods: The data were merged administrative records from public behavioral health and criminal justice systems in Connecticut for 712 adults with serious mental illness who participated in the jail diversion program during fiscal years 2005-2007. The effects on treatment receipt, crisis-driven service use, and reoffending during the six months postdiversion among jail first participants (N=102) versus a propensity-matched sample of participants who were diverted immediately (N=102) were estimated.Results: Jail first participants had greater improvements in receipt of psychotropic medication during the follow-up compared with their counterparts who were diverted immediately. However, compared with participants who were immediately diverted, they did not have greater reductions in crisis-driven service use or reoffending and the time to reincarceration was shorter.Conclusions: Short stays in jail before diversion did not appear to be associated with improved mental health and reoffending outcomes, even though they appeared to improve receipt of psychotropic medication. Further research is needed to better understand the relationships between jail first, receipt of psychotropic medication, and broader health and offending outcomes, with a focus on identifying missing links that address criminogenic risks and participants more intensive social service needs.","Robertson, Allison G",10.1176/appi.ps.201300286,Psychiatric Services,mental health and reoffending outcomes of jail diversion participants with a brief incarceration after arraignment.,Sep2014

305,"OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with higher rates of health complaints and medical conditions diagnosed by physicians, yet research examining the relationship between PTSD and health care utilization has been limited. This study compared the health service use of veterans with PTSD to that of help-seeking veterans without PTSD. The relationship between severity of PTSD and service utilization was also examined. METHOD: Data were collected from 996 veterans seeking an evaluation at a Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center specialty PTSD clinic in the southeastern United States between March 1992 and September 1998. Data included sociodemographic characteristics, severity of PTSD, and disability status. The outcome variable, VA health service utilization, was prospectively assessed 1 year from the date of the initial PTSD assessment. RESULTS: Although the use of VA mental health services by patients with PTSD was substantial (a median of seven clinic stops), these patients used more services in general physical health clinics that provided predominantly nonmental health services (a median of 18 clinic stops). Negative binomial regression models revealed that younger veterans with PTSD had greater health care utilization than those without PTSD who also sought services. Greater severity of PTSD was related to higher rates of mental and physical health service use among veterans without a service-connected disability. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD is associated with substantial health service use. The results highlight the importance of increased collaboration between primary care and mental health specialists, given that patients with PTSD are more likely to receive treatment in nonmental health clinics.",Calhoun PS,NLM12450960,American Journal of Psychiatry,medical service utilization by veterans seeking help for posttraumatic stress disorder.,Dec2002
373,"BACKGROUND. Investigators from several states have reported that children entering foster care are at risk for medical and mental health conditions. Additional information based on data from a larger statewide population of children in foster care would assist in the development of appropriate strategies of care for these children. OBJECTIVES. The purpose of this work was to describe the prevalence of medical and mental health conditions, the number of referrals for specialty care, the use of medications and to compare the prevalence of these conditions across age groups of children entering foster care in Utah. METHODS. We conducted an analysis of a statewide database containing abstracted medical and mental health information from the initial medical and mental health assessments of all children entering foster care between January 1, 2001, and December 16, 2004. RESULTS. Of the 6177 children who entered foster care during the study period, 83% were white and 24% were Hispanic. One or more acute or chronic medical conditions were present in 54%, and 44% had >/=1 mental health condition. The most prevalent medical conditions in all of the children were overweight or obesity (35%), 30% had a referral for specialty care. The most prevalent mental health conditions were oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder (18%), reactive attachment and adjustment disorders (17%), and mood disorders (15%). The frequency of psychotropic medication use increased with age. Of the 2747 children of all ages with a diagnosed mental health condition, 35% were receiving psychotropic medications. CONCLUSIONS. This study of a statewide cohort of children entering foster care supports and strengthens previous evidence that children in foster care are more likely to have more health care needs compared with the general pediatric population. Focused strategies are needed that address prevalent conditions, the need for continuity of care, ongoing mental health services, and medication management.",Steele JS,NLM18762506,Pediatrics,medical and mental health of children entering the utah foster care system.,Sep2008

112,"Background: The integration of maternal mental health into primary health care has been advocated to reduce the mental health treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study reports findings of a cross-country situation analysis on maternal mental health and services available in five LMICs, to inform the development of integrated maternal mental health services integrated into primary health care.Methods: The situation analysis was conducted in five districts in Ethiopia, India, Nepal, South Africa and Uganda, as part of the Programme for Improving Mental Health Care (PRIME). The analysis reports secondary data on the prevalence and impact of priority maternal mental disorders (perinatal depression, alcohol use disorders during pregnancy and puerperal psychosis), existing policies, plans and services for maternal mental health, and other relevant contextual factors, such as explanatory models for mental illness.Results: Limited data were available at the district level, although generalizable data from other sites was identified in most cases. Community and facility-based prevalences ranged widely across PRIME countries for perinatal depression (3-50 %) and alcohol consumption during pregnancy (5-51 %). Maternal mental health was included in mental health policies in South Africa, India and Ethiopia, and a mental health care plan was in the process of being implemented in South Africa. No district reported dedicated maternal mental health services, but referrals to specialised care in psychiatric units or general hospitals were possible. No information was available on coverage for maternal mental health care. Challenges to the provision of maternal mental health care included; limited evidence on feasible detection and treatment strategies for maternal mental disorders, lack of mental health specialists in the public health sector, lack of prescribing guidelines for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and stigmatising attitudes among primary health care staff and the community.Conclusions: It is difficult to anticipate demand for mental health care at district level in the five countries, given the lack of evidence on the prevalence and treatment coverage of women with maternal mental disorders. Limited evidence on effective psychosocial interventions was also noted, and must be addressed for mental health programmes, such as PRIME, to implement feasible and effective services.","Baron, Emily C.",10.1186/s12913-016-1291-z,BMC Health Services Research,maternal mental health in primary care in five low- and middle-income countries: a situational analysis.,2/16/2016

For several respondents, acceptance of biomedical causality was linked to helplessness. In contrast, spiritual beliefs offered hope.Conclusions: Alleviating patients sense of responsibility may reduce their guilt, but patients perceptions of illness uncontrollability may diminish their sense of agency, reinforce depressive attributional styles, and undermine overall treatment outcomes.

153,"Objective: Major depressive episodes (MDE) make an important contribution to disease burden in Canada. The epidemiology of MDE in the national population has been examined in 2 mental health surveys, one conducted in 2002 and the other in 2012. Our objective was to compare selected variables from the 2 surveys to determine whether changes have occurred in the prevalence, treatment, and impact of MDE.Method: The World Health Organization World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used in both surveys and the MDE module (which was not modified) was scored using the same algorithm. Some variables assessing impact and management of MDE were also identical in the 2 surveys. The analysis was based on frequency estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals.Results: The annual prevalence of MDE was 4.7% (95% CI 4.3% to 5.1%) in 2012, nearly identical to 4.8% (95% CI 4.5% to 5.1%) in 2002. Receipt of potentially adequate treatment (defined as taking an antidepressant or 6 or more visits to a health professional for mental health reasons) increased from 41.3% in 2002 to 52.2% in 2012, mostly due to an increase in respondents reporting 6 or more visits. Use of second generation antipsychotics also increased. There was no evidence of diminishing prevalence or impact (as assessed by symptoms of distress).Conclusions: There appears to have been an increase in receipt of treatment for people with MDE and a changing pattern of management. However, it was not possible to confirm that the impact of MDE is diminishing as a result.","Patten, Scott B.",10.1177/0706743715625940,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,major depression in canada: what has changed over the past 10 years?,Feb2016

272,"Objective: This study sought to determine whether previously reported poor outcomes among patients of low socioeconomic status who have depression and anxiety could result from not receiving mental health treatment or from receiving minimally adequate treatment.Methods: The study sample consisted of 1,772 participants in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) who met criteria for a mood or anxiety disorder. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between education, income, and assets and receipt of treatment and quality of treatment (minimally adequate treatment) for mood and anxiety disorders in sectors with the capacity to deliver evidence-based treatments (the general medical and mental health specialty sectors). Multivariate analyses controlled for age, gender, race-ethnicity, marital status, health insurance, and urbanicity.Results: Age, gender, marital status, and race-ethnicity were strong and fairly consistent predictors of mental health services use, with some modest variations by sector. In contrast, in bivariate and multivariate analyses, education, income, and assets were minimally related to use of mental health care and to receipt of minimally adequate care in both general medical and mental health specialty sectors.Conclusions: Socioeconomic status does not appear to play a major role in determining aspects of treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. Poor outcomes of depressed and anxious patients with low socioeconomic status may be due to differences in quality of care beyond the minimally adequate level assessed in this study or to factors unrelated to quality of care that could counteract effective treatments, such as the presence of ongoing chronic stress.",Roy-Byrne PP,10.1176/ps.2009.60.9.1190,Psychiatric Services,low socioeconomic status and mental health care use among respondents with anxiety and depression in the ncs-r.,Sep2009

Study participants were between age 18 and 67, utilized specialty mental health care services, were prescribed antipsychotic medications, and were not dually eligible for Medicare. Adjusted Poisson regression models were used to estimate the overall effects of predictor variables on HIV testing prevalence.Results: During the study period, 6.7% of people with severe mental illness received HIV testing. Men were 32% less likely to be tested for HIV than women (p<.001). Compared with whites, Asians/Pacific Islanders were 53% less likely and blacks were 82% more likely to be tested (p<.001). Those with comorbid drug or alcohol use disorders were more likely to be tested than those without such disorders (p<.001). Utilization of nonpsychiatric medical care was the strongest predictor of HIV testing (p<.001).Conclusions: Most adults with severe mental illness receiving public specialty mental health services were not tested for HIV during a one-year period. Public health administrators must prioritize HIV testing for early identification of HIV infection and prevention of HIV transmission.","Mangurian, Christina",10.1176/appi.ps.201600248,Psychiatric Services,low rates of hiv testing among adults with severe mental illness receiving care in community mental health settings.,May2017

145,"Objective: This study compared recidivism among mental health court (MHC) participants and MHC-eligible defendants in traditional criminal court (TCC) two years after MHC exit or court disposition to investigate longer-term MHC impacts and effects beyond provision of treatment and services.Methods: Archival data from the pretrial services agency and MHC judges were used. Four measures of recidivism (any rearrest, number of rearrests, any felony arrest, and time to rearrest) were used to compare 408 MHC participants and 687 MHC-eligible defendants in TCC in the same judicial district. Both groups were provided individualized plans from the same package of services and supervision by the same pretrial services and community agencies. MHC completers and noncompleters were examined separately. Multivariate logistic analyses controlled for confounding variables.Results: Reductions in recidivism were observed in all three groups from two years before the key arrest to two years after court exit or court disposition. The reduction was greatest among MHC completers: the proportion rearrested was smallest (25%), and completers had the lowest number of arrests (.42). The noncompleter group had the largest proportion of those rearrested (55%) and the highest number of arrests (1.21). When confounding variables were controlled, MHC completers, not noncompleters, differed significantly from the comparison group in two-year recidivism.Conclusions: MHC participation can reduce recidivism for an extended time after court exit and may have an impact on individuals who complete the program beyond the provision of treatment and services. Further study is needed to determine which MHC components may have this additional effect.","Hiday, Virginia Aldigé",10.1176/appi.ps.201400569,Psychiatric Services,longer-term impacts of mental health courts: recidivism two years after exit.,Apr2016

191,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the many studies of public attitudes toward mental illnesses, relatively few have examined the views of the youngest generation of citizens. This study was intended to increase understanding of youths views of mental illness by developing and administering measures of knowledge and attitudes of middle school students toward mental illnesses. METHODS: Self-report questionnaires concerning knowledge, attitudes, and social distance related to mental illness were developed and pilot-tested to create an assessment tool appropriate for a juvenile sample. The measures were administered to 193 students at four middle schools in different parts of the United States between November 2008 and April 2009. RESULTS: The students knowledge about mental illness was inconsistent, but important gaps were evident, particularly with respect to the symptoms of specific disorders. Attitudes toward individuals with a mental illness were generally positive, but substantial numbers of students had less favorable attitudes. Social distance scores revealed considerable reluctance to interact closely with a person with mental illness. Most (65%) students were uncertain whether mental illnesses have a biological cause, and 37% believed that medication to treat mental illness is useful. CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes toward individuals with mental illnesses may be more favorable among students than among adults. Nevertheless, stigma may persist as a problem for the next generation of citizens, and youths with a mental illness remain likely to experience misunderstanding and exclusion by peers. There is a need to educate children about specific disorders and about acceptance of individuals with mental illness.",Wahl O,10.1176/appi.ps.201100358,Psychiatric Services,knowledge and attitudes about mental illness: a survey of middle school students.,Jul2012

86,"Background: Adults with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders (CODs) are overrepresented in jails. In-custody barriers to treatment, including a lack of evidence-based treatment options and the often short periods of incarceration, and limited communication between jails and community-based treatment agencies that can hinder immediate enrollment into community care once released have contributed to a cycle of limited treatment engagement, unaddressed criminogenic risks, and (re)arrest among this vulnerable and high-risk population. This paper describes a study that will develop research and communication protocols and adapt two evidence-based treatments, dual-diagnosis motivational interviewing (DDMI) and integrated group therapy (IGT), for delivery to adults with CODs across a jail-to-community treatment continuum.Methods/design: Adaptations to DDMI and IGT were guided by the Risk-Need-Responsivity model and the National Institute of Corrections implementation competencies; the development of the implementation framework and communication protocols were guided by the Evidence-Based Interagency Implementation Model for community corrections and the Inter-organizational Relationship model, respectively. Implementation and evaluation of the protocols and adapted interventions will occur via an open trial and a pilot randomized trial. The clinical intervention consists of two in-jail DDMI sessions and 12 in-community IGT sessions. Twelve adults with CODs and four clinicians will participate in the open trial to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of, and fidelity to, the interventions and research and communication protocols. The pilot controlled trial will be conducted with 60 inmates who will be randomized to either DDMI-IGT or treatment as usual. A baseline assessment will be conducted in jail, and four community-based assessments will be conducted during a 6-month follow-up period. Implementation, clinical, public health, and treatment preference outcomes will be evaluated.Discussion: Findings have the potential to improve both jail- and community-based treatment services for adults with CODs as well as inform methods for conducting rigorous pilot implementation and evaluation research in correctional settings and as inmates re-enter the community. Findings will contribute to a growing area of work focused on interrupting the cycle of limited treatment engagement, unaddressed criminogenic risks, and (re)arrest among adults with CODs.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02214667 .

152,"Background: Suicide is a major cause of preventable death, and suicidal behaviour is prevalent in acute psychiatric wards. People admitted to acute psychiatric wards often experience repeated episodes of suicidal behaviour, causing great distress and heavy use of NHS services. There is little research investigating effective psychological treatments for suicidal patients in inpatient settings although previous research has found support for psychological therapies which specifically target suicidal behaviour. This paper describes the protocol of a single blind RCT to investigate the acceptability and feasibility of a cognitive behavioural intervention targeting suicidality (CBSP) for suicidal people in acute psychiatric wards.Methods/design: A single blind RCT comparing treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU plus Cognitive Behavioural Suicide Prevention (CBSP) therapy (TAU +?CBSP). Sixty participants (aged 18-65 years) who are suicidal, or have been within the past 3 months, will be recruited from NHS trusts in the North West of England. Our primary objective is to determine whether CBSP is feasible, acceptable and efficacious when compared to patients who receive TAU alone. Secondary aims are the impact of CBSP on suicidal thinking, behaviours, functioning, quality of life, service use and psychological factors associated with suicide. Assessments take place at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months (end of treatment). The analysis will report on the feasibility and acceptability of CBSP. Qualitative data from staff and service users will inform feasibility and acceptability data.Discussion: Psychiatric inpatients are a high-risk group and the use of psychological therapies in these settings is rare and requires evaluation. This study is essential to investigate the unique contextual challenges involved in delivering psychological therapy to suicidal inpatients and to identify any necessary modifications required within inpatient settings. The findings will inform a larger, definitive trial.Trial Registration: 15 March 2012, PB-PG-1111-26026, NIHR ISRCTN17890126 .","Haddock, Gillian",10.1186/s13063-016-1192-9,Trials,investigating the feasibility and acceptability of a cognitive behavioural suicide prevention therapy for people in acute psychiatric wards (the insite trial): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,2/11/2016

100,"Objective: Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) has been developed for the treatment of depression but has been examined for several other mental disorders. A comprehensive meta-analysis of all randomized trials examining the effects of IPT for all mental health problems was conducted.Method: Searches in PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and Cochrane were conducted to identify all trials examining IPT for any mental health problem.Results: Ninety studies with 11,434 participants were included. IPT for acute-phase depression had moderate-to-large effects compared with control groups (g=0.60; 95% CI=0.45-0.75). No significant difference was found with other therapies (differential g=0.06) and pharmacotherapy (g=-0.13). Combined treatment was more effective than IPT alone (g=0.24). IPT in subthreshold depression significantly prevented the onset of major depression, and maintenance IPT significantly reduced relapse. IPT had significant effects on eating disorders, but the effects are probably slightly smaller than those of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in the acute phase of treatment. In anxiety disorders, IPT had large effects compared with control groups, and there is no evidence that IPT was less effective than CBT. There was risk of bias as defined by the Cochrane Collaboration in the majority of studies. There was little indication that the presence of bias influenced outcome.Conclusions: IPT is effective in the acute treatment of depression and may be effective in the prevention of new depressive disorders and in preventing relapse. IPT may also be effective in the treatment of eating disorders and anxiety disorders and has shown promising effects in some other mental health disorders.","Cuijpers, Pim",10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15091141,American Journal of Psychiatry,interpersonal psychotherapy for mental health problems: a comprehensive meta-analysis.,Jul2016

291,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the first of the two core questions around which the ACCESS (Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports) evaluation was designed: Does implementation of system-change strategies lead to better integration of service systems? METHODS: The study was part of the five-year federal ACCESS service demonstration program, which sought to enhance integration of service delivery systems for homeless persons with serious mental illness. Data were gathered from nine randomly selected experimental sites and nine comparison sites in 15 of the nations largest cities on the degree to which each site implemented a set of systems integration strategies and the degree of systems integration that ensued among community agencies across five service sectors: mental health, substance abuse, primary care, housing, and social welfare and entitlement services. Integration was measured across all interorganizational relationships in the local service networks (overall systems integration) and across relationships involving only the primary ACCESS grantee organization (project-centered integration). RESULTS: Contrary to expectations, the nine experimental sites did not demonstrate significantly greater overall systems integration than the nine comparison sites. However, the experimental sites demonstrated better project-centered integration than the comparison sites. Moreover, more extensive implementation of strategies for system change was associated with higher levels of overall systems integration as well as project-centered integration at both the experimental sites and the comparison sites.

119,"Objective: This evaluation was designed to assess the impact of providing integrated primary and mental health care on utilization and costs for outpatient medical, inpatient hospital, and emergency department treatment among persons with serious mental illness.Methods: Two safety-net, community mental health centers that received a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration (PBHCI) grant were the focus of this study. Clinic 1 had a ten-year history of providing integrated services whereas clinic 2 began integrated services with the PBHCI grant. Difference-in-differences (DID) analyses were used to compare individuals enrolled in the PBHCI programs (N=373, clinic 1; N=389, clinic 2) with propensity score-matched comparison groups of equal size at each site by using data obtained from medical records.Results: Relative to the comparison groups, a higher proportion of PBHCI clients used outpatient medical services at both sites following program enrollment (p<.003, clinic 1; p<.001, clinic 2). At clinic 1, PBHCI was also associated with a reduction in the proportion of clients with an inpatient hospital admission (p=.04) and a trend for a reduction in inpatient hospital costs per member per month of $217.68 (p=.06). Hospital-related cost savings were not observed for PBHCI clients at clinic 2 nor were there significant differences between emergency department use or costs for PBHCI and comparison groups at either clinic.Conclusions: Investments in PBHCI can improve access to outpatient medical care for persons with severe mental illness and may also curb hospitalizations and associated costs in more established programs.","Krupski, Antoinette",10.1176/appi.ps.201500424,Psychiatric Services,integrating primary care into community mental health centers: impact on utilization and costs of health care.,Nov2016
185,"OBJECTIVE This article describes the characteristics and early implementation experiences of community behavioral health agencies that received Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration (PBHCI) grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to integrate primary care into programs for adults with serious mental illness. METHODS Data were collected from 56 programs, across 26 states, that received PBHCI grants in 2009 (N=13) or 2010 (N=43). The authors systematically extracted quantitative and qualitative information about program characteristics from grantee proposals and semistructured telephone interviews with core program staff. Quarterly reports submitted by grantees were coded to identify barriers to implementing integrated care. RESULTS Grantees shared core features required by the grant but varied widely in terms of characteristics of the organization, such as size and location, and in the way services were integrated, such as through partnerships with a primary care agency. Barriers to program implementation at start-up included difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified staff and issues related to data collection and use of electronic health records, licensing and approvals, and physical space. By the end of the first year, some problems, such as space issues, were largely resolved, but other issues, including problems with staffing and data collection, remained. New challenges, such as patient recruitment, had emerged. CONCLUSIONS Early implementation experiences of PBHCI grantees may inform other programs that seek to integrate primary care into behavioral health settings as part of new, large-scale government initiatives, such as specialty mental health homes.","Scharf, Deborah M",10.1176/appi.ps.201200269,Psychiatric Services,integrating primary care into community behavioral health settings: programs and early implementation experiences.,Jul2013

Program participation of 100 patients from two long-term civil units was compared with program participation of 94 patients from the hospitals medium- and maximum-security forensic units.Results: The forensic patients were significantly less likely to refuse to join or to leave a group, and they were better engaged in their treatment. The use of restrictive interventions and the incidence of assault were minimal for both groups.Conclusions: The experience at Dorothea Dix Hospital suggests that integrating these populations in rehabilitative programming is not only fiscally responsible but also clinically promising, with no evidence of greater disruptiveness attributable to forensic patients.",Webster SL,10.1176/appi.ps.60.2.262,Psychiatric Services,integrating forensically and civilly committed adult inpatients in a treatment mall program at a state hospital.,Feb2009

114,"Background: Despite depression being one of the most prevalent mental disorders in the world, access to treatment is still insufficient, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study is to investigate differences in access to treatment for depression according to socio-demographic characteristics, geographical area and multi-morbidity in a nationally representative sample of individuals with depression. Methods: This study analyses data from the National Health Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde -- PNS), a Brazilian household-based nationwide survey, which comprises 60,202 adults (aged 18 years or older). Depression was evaluated through the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Prevalence Ratios and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using Poisson regression. Results: The general prevalence of depression was 7.9 % (95 % CI 7.5 to 8.3). Among those with depression, 78.8 % did not receive any treatment, and 14.1 % received only pharmacotherapy. Multivariable analyses showed that being female, white, aged between 30 and 69 years, living in regions other than the North, having higher education and having multi-morbidities were independently associated with higher likelihood of access to any treatment. Conclusions: Most Brazilians with clinically relevant depressive symptoms are not receiving any treatment. Access to care is unequal, with the poor and those living in low resource areas having higher difficulties to access mental health care. Understanding these disparities is important for the provision of effective interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of depression and inequities in access to mental health care.","Souza Lopes, Claudia",10.1186/s12939-016-0446-1,International Journal for Equity in Health,inequities in access to depression treatment: results of the brazilian national health survey -- pns.,11/17/2016

344,"Background: Bangladesh has the highest natural disaster mortality rate in the world, with over half a million people lost to disaster events since 1970. Most of these people have died during floods or cyclones, both of which are likely to become more frequent due to global climate change. To date, the governments post-disaster response strategy has focused, increasingly effectively, on the physical needs of survivors, through the provision of shelter, food and medical care. However, the serious and widespread mental health consequences of natural disasters in Bangladesh have not yet received the attention that they deserve. This Debate article proposes a practical model that will facilitate the provision of comprehensive and effective post-disaster mental health services for vulnerable Bangladeshis on a sustainable basis.Discussion: A series of socially determined factors render the women and the poor of Bangladesh particularly vulnerable to dying in natural disasters; and, for those who survive, to suffering from some sort of disaster-related mental health illness. For women, this is largely due to the enforced gender separation, or purdah, that they endure; while for the poor, it is the fact that they are, by definition, only able to afford to live in the most climatically dangerous, and under-served parts of the country. Although the disasters themselves are brought by nature, therefore, social determinants increase the vulnerability of particular groups to mental illness as a result of them. While deeply entrenched, these determinants are at least partially amenable to change through policy and action.Summary: In response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the World Health Organisation developed a framework for providing mental health and psychosocial support after major disasters, which, we argue, could be adapted to Bangladeshi post-cyclone and post-flood contexts. The framework is community-based, it includes both medical and non-clinical components, and it could be adapted so that women and the poor are actively sought out and provided for. After training, these services could be run by Bangladeshs pre-existing 50,000-strong Cyclone Preparedness Programme workforce, alongside the countrys extensive network of community-based health workers.","Nahar, Nazmun",10.1186/1471-2458-14-708,BMC Public Health,"increasing the provision of mental health care for vulnerable, disaster-affected people in bangladesh.",2014

Records of patients with comorbidities more often indicated accounting codes for ""complex diagnostic procedures,"" ""crisis intervention,"" and ""constant observation."" Patients with comorbid disorders differed from patients with a main diagnosis of personality disorder in treatment indicator characteristics and distribution of personality disorder diagnoses.Conclusions: Personality disorder comorbidity made MDD treatment more complex, and recurrence of MDD episodes and hospital readmission occurred more often than if patients had a sole MDD diagnosis.","Wiegand, Hauke F.",10.1176/appi.ps.201600192,Psychiatric Services,increased treatment complexity for major depressive disorder for inpatients with comorbid personality disorder.,May2017

We used US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) electronic health records from 2001 to 2014 to examine incidence rates and sociodemographic risk factors for mental health diagnoses among 888 142 veterans. Results. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was the most frequently diagnosed mental health condition across gender and age groups. Incidence rates for all mental health diagnoses were highest at ages 18 to 29 years and declined thereafter, with the exceptions of major depressive disorder (MDD) in both genders, and PTSD among women. Risk of incident bipolar disorder and MDD diagnoses were greater among women; risk of incident schizophrenia, and alcohol- and drug-use disorders diagnoses were greater in men. Compared with Whites, risk incident PTSD, MDD, and alcohol-use disorder diagnoses were lower at ages 18 to 29 years and higher at ages 45 to 64 years for both Hispanics and African Americans.

235,"OBJECTIVE: Incarceration of people with mental illness has become a major social, clinical, and economic concern, with an estimated 2.1 million incarcerations in 2007. Prior studies have primarily focused on mental illness rates among incarcerated persons. This study examined rates of and risk factors for incarceration and reincarceration, as well as short-term outcomes after incarceration, among patients in a large public mental health system. METHODS: The data set included 39,463 patient records combined with 4,544 matching incarceration records from the county jail system during fiscal year 2005-2006. Risk factors for incarceration and reincarceration were analyzed with logistic regression. Time after release from the index incarceration until receiving services was examined with survival analysis. RESULTS: During the year, 11.5% of patients (N=4,544) were incarcerated. Risk factors for incarceration included prior incarcerations; co-occurring substance-related diagnoses; homelessness; schizophrenia, bipolar, or other psychotic disorder diagnoses; male gender; no Medicaid insurance; and being African American. Patients older than 45, Medicaid beneficiaries, and those from Latino, Asian, and other non-Euro-American racial-ethnic groups were less likely to be incarcerated. Risk factors for reincarceration included co-occurring substance-related diagnoses; prior incarceration; diagnosed schizophrenia or bipolar disorder; homelessness; and incarceration for three or fewer days. Patients whose first service after release from incarceration was outpatient or case management were less likely to receive subsequent emergency services or to be reincarcerated within 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable factors affecting incarceration risk include homelessness, substance abuse, lack of medical insurance, and timely receipt of outpatient or case management services after release from incarceration.

365,"Background: Evidence-based treatments for child mental health problems are not consistently available in public mental health settings. Expanding availability requires workforce training. However, research has demonstrated that training alone is not sufficient for changing provider behavior, suggesting that ongoing intervention-specific supervision or consultation is required. Supervision is notably under-investigated, particularly as provided in public mental health. The degree to which supervision in this setting includes gold standard supervision elements from efficacy trials (e.g., session review, model fidelity, outcome monitoring, skill-building) is unknown. The current federally-funded investigation leverages the Washington State Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Initiative to describe usual supervision practices and test the impact of systematic implementation of gold standard supervision strategies on treatment fidelity and clinical outcomes.Methods/design: The study has two phases. We will conduct an initial descriptive study (Phase I) of supervision practices within public mental health in Washington State followed by a randomized controlled trial of gold standard supervision strategies (Phase II), with randomization at the clinician level (i.e., supervisors provide both conditions). Study participants will be 35 supervisors and 130 clinicians in community mental health centers. We will enroll one child per clinician in Phase I (N?=?130) and three children per clinician in Phase II (N?=?390). We use a multi-level mixed within- and between-subjects longitudinal design. Audio recordings of supervision and therapy sessions will be collected and coded throughout both phases. Child outcome data will be collected at the beginning of treatment and at three and six months into treatment.Discussion: This study will provide insight into how supervisors can optimally support clinicians delivering evidence-based treatments. Phase I will provide descriptive information, currently unavailable in the literature, about commonly used supervision strategies in community mental health. The Phase II randomized controlled trial of gold standard supervision strategies is, to our knowledge, the first experimental study of gold standard supervision strategies in community mental health and will yield needed information about how to leverage supervision to improve clinician fidelity and client outcomes.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01800266.","Dorsey, Shannon",10.1186/1748-5908-8-89,Implementation Science,improving practice in community-based settings: a randomized trial of supervision - study protocol.,2013

180,"Objective: To investigate equity of patient outcomes in a psychological therapy service, following increased access achieved by a quality improvement (QI) initiative.Design: Retrospective service evaluation of health outcomes; data analysed by ANOVA, chi-squared and Statistical Process Control.Setting: A psychological therapy service in Westminster, London, UK.Participants: People living in the Borough of Westminster, London, attending the service (from either healthcare professional or self-referral) between February 2009 and May 2012.Intervention: s) Social marketing interventions were used to increase referrals, including the promotion of the service through local media and through existing social networks.Main Outcome Measure: s) (i) Severity of depression on entry using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9). (ii) Changes to severity of depression following treatment (?PHQ9). (iii) Changes in attainment of a meaningful improvement in condition assessed by a key performance indicator.Results: Patients from areas of high deprivation entered the service with more severe depression (M = 15.47, SD = 6.75), compared with patients from areas of low (M = 13.20, SD = 6.75) and medium (M = 14.44, SD = 6.64) deprivation. Patients in low, medium and high deprivation areas attained similar changes in depression score (?PHQ9: M = -6.60, SD = 6.41). Similar proportions of patients achieved the key performance indicator across initiative phase and deprivation categories.Conclusions: QI methods improved access to mental health services; this paper finds no evidence for differences in clinical outcomes in patients, regardless of level of deprivation, interpreted as no evidence of inequity in the service with respect to this outcome.","Poots, Alan J",10.1093/intqhc/mzu005,International Journal for Quality in Health Care,improving mental health outcomes: achieving equity through quality improvement.,Apr2014
313,"Objective: Improving depression treatment is critical given low rates of appropriate care. Health plan performance measures that address quality of antidepressant medication management, specifically, have been stagnating at relatively low levels. Identifying health plan characteristics associated with better performance could contribute to quality improvement for this aspect of depression treatment.Methods: Data for 2003 were linked from two sources: a nationally representative survey of 368 health plans about their behavioral health services and the National Committee for Quality Assurances Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) antidepressant medication management (AMM) scores, which reflect the percentage of eligible members whose care met specified criteria. The analytic sample present in both data sets totaled 361 products offered by 183 plans. Plan characteristics were grouped into organizational, provider, and consumer domains. Bivariate tests and regression analyses were conducted to estimate the relationship between these characteristics and health plan performance on three AMM measures: effective acute-phase treatment, effective continuation-phase treatment, and optimal practitioner contact.Results: Mean HEDIS AMM scores were 60% for effective acute-phase treatment, 43% for continuation-phase treatment, and 22% for optimal practitioner contact. Individual feedback to clinicians about their performance, lower cost sharing for outpatient mental health, and greater access to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were significantly associated with better plan performance in terms of antidepressant medication management.Conclusions: Health plan characteristics were significantly associated with the quality of one important aspect of depression care, antidepressant medication management. Many of the factors that were identified suggest actionable ways for plans to improve quality of depression care.",Horgan CM,10.1176/ps.2008.59.1.72,Psychiatric Services,improving medication management of depression in health plans.,Jan2008

307,"OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine whether integrated mental health services or enhanced referral to specialty mental health clinics results in greater engagement in mental health/substance abuse services by older primary care patients. METHOD: This multisite randomized trial included 10 sites consisting of primary care and specialty mental health/substance abuse clinics. Primary care patients 65 years old or older (N=24,930) were screened. The final study group consisted of 2,022 patients (mean age=73.5 years; 26% female; 48% ethnic minority) with depression (N=1,390), anxiety (N=70), at-risk alcohol use (N=414), or dual diagnosis (N=148) who were randomly assigned to integrated care (mental health and substance abuse providers co-located in primary care; N=999) or enhanced referral to specialty mental health/substance abuse clinics (i.e., facilitated scheduling, transportation, payment; N=1,023). RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of patients engaged in treatment in the integrated model compared with 49% in the enhanced referral model. Integrated care was associated with more mental health and substance abuse visits per patient (mean=3.04) relative to enhanced referral (mean=1.91). Overall, greater engagement was predicted by integrated care and higher mental distress. For depression, greater engagement was predicted by integrated care and more severe depression. For at-risk alcohol users, greater engagement was predicted by integrated care and more severe problem drinking. For all conditions, greater engagement was associated with closer proximity of mental health/substance abuse services to primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Older primary care patients are more likely to accept collaborative mental health treatment within primary care than in mental health/substance abuse clinics. These results suggest that integrated service arrangements improve access to mental health and substance abuse services for older adults who underuse these services.",Bartels SJ,NLM15285973,American Journal of Psychiatry,"improving access to geriatric mental health services: a randomized trial comparing treatment engagement with integrated versus enhanced referral care for depression, anxiety, and at-risk alcohol use.",Aug2004

375,"Background: This study investigated the costs and outcomes of implementing cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in a mental health center (MHC). CBT is an evidence-based treatment for CFS that was scarcely available until now. To investigate the possibilities for wider implementation, a pilot implementation project was set up. Method: Costs and effects were evaluated in a non-controlled before- and after study with an eight months time-horizon. Both the costs of performing the treatments and the costs of implementing the treatment program were included in the analysis. The implementation interventions included: informing general practitioners (GPs) and CFS patients, training therapists, and instructing the MHC employees. Given the non-controlled design, cost outcome ratios (CORs) and their acceptability curves were analyzed. Analyses were done from a health care perspective and from a societal perspective. Bootstrap analyses were performed to estimate the uncertainty around the cost and outcome results. Results: 125 CFS patients were included in the study. After treatment 37% had recovered from CFS and the mean gained QALY was 0.03. Costs of patients health care and productivity losses had decreased significantly. From the societal perspective the implementation led to cost savings and to higher health states for patients, indicating dominancy. From the health care perspective the implementation revealed overall costs of €5.320 per recovered patient, with an acceptability curve showing a 100% probability for a positive COR at a willingness to pay threshold of €6.500 per recovered patient. Conclusion: Implementing CBT for CFS in a MHC appeared to have a favorable cost outcome ratio (COR) from a societal perspective. From a health care perspective the COR depended on how much a recovered CFS patient is being valued. The strength of the evidence was limited by the non-controlled design. The outcomes of this study might facilitate health care providers when confronted with the decision whether or not to adopt CBT for CFS in their institution.",Scheeres K,NLM18700975,BMC Health Services Research,implementing cognitive behavior therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome in mental health care: a costs and outcomes analysis.,2008

127,"Objective: The authors objective was to determine how assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) has been implemented in actual practice in the 45 states with AOT statutes.Methods: A national survey of AOT programs was conducted to examine the extent to which AOT programs have been implemented and variations in implementation models.Results: Although 45 states have current AOT statutes, the most active programs were identified in 20 states. These programs varied considerably in style of implementation, criteria applied, agency responsible, use of a treatment plan, monitoring procedures, and numbers of participants involved. Three implementation models were identified: community gateway, hospital transition, and surveillance (or safety net). Common problems included inadequate resources, lack of enforcement power, inconsistent monitoring, and weakness of interagency collaboration.Conclusions: AOT is a widely applied and much-discussed mechanism for providing treatment to individuals with serious mental illnesses nationally. The uneven implementation of AOT programs within and across states highlights the ambivalence in the community, by judicial officials, and by mental health clinicians about the role and scope of AOT and the difficulties of implementation under existing funding constraints and statutory limitations.","Meldrum, Marcia L.",10.1176/appi.ps.201500073,Psychiatric Services,implementation status of assisted outpatient treatment programs: a national survey.,Jun2016

This study examined its effectiveness when used with homeless women veterans with psychiatric or substance abuse problems at 11 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers that had Homeless Women Veterans Programs.Methods: The intervention consists of 25 sessions that cover topics to help build safety in clients lives and is present-focused, offering psychoeducation and coping skills. A cohort of homeless women veterans (N=359) was recruited before Seeking Safety was implemented (phase I). After clinicians were trained and certified in Seeking Safety, a postimplementation cohort was recruited and offered Seeking Safety treatment (phase II, N=91). Phase I lasted from January 2000 to June 2003. Phase II lasted from June 2003 to December 2005. The intervention lasted for six months. All participants were interviewed every three months for one year and received intensive case management and other services during the study. Mixed models were used to compare one-year clinical outcomes across phases.Results: There were few differences across groups at baseline. All women entering the Homeless Women Veterans Programs showed significant improvement on most clinical outcome measures over one year. The Seeking Safety cohort reported significantly better outcomes over one year in employment, social support, general symptoms of psychiatric distress, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, particularly in the avoidance and arousal clusters. However, the Seeking Safety cohort was significantly more likely to have used drugs in the past 30 days.Conclusions: Seeking Safety appears to have had a moderately beneficial impact on several clinical outcomes. Although the nonequivalent comparison groups and low follow-up rates limit the internal validity of these results, availability of Seeking Safety may be of benefit for homeless female veterans. It is noteworthy that it could be delivered and implemented by case managers with little or no prior counseling experience.",Desai RA,10.1176/ps.2008.59.9.996,Psychiatric Services,impact of the seeking safety program on clinical outcomes among homeless female veterans with psychiatric disorders.,Sep2008

348,"Objective: Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) is a standardized psychosocial intervention that is designed to help people with severe mental illness manage their illness and achieve personal recovery goals. This literature review summarizes the research on consumer-level effects of IMR and articles describing its implementation.Methods: In 2011, the authors conducted a literature search of Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library by using the key words ""illness management and recovery,"" ""wellness management and recovery,"" or ""IMR"" AND (""schizophrenia"" OR ""bipolar"" OR ""depression"" OR ""recovery"" OR ""mental health""). Publications that cited two seminal IMR articles also guided further exploration of sources. Articles that did not deal explicitly with IMR or a direct adaptation were excluded.Results: Three randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), three quasi-controlled trials, and three pre-post trials have been conducted. The RCTs found that consumers receiving IMR reported significantly more improved scores on the IMR Scale (IMRS) than consumers who received treatment as usual. IMRS ratings by clinicians and ratings of psychiatric symptoms by independent observers were also more improved for the IMR consumers. Implementation studies (N=16) identified several important barriers to and facilitators of IMR, including supervision and agency support. Implementation outcomes, such as participation rates and fidelity, varied widely.Conclusions: IMR shows promise for improving some consumer-level outcomes. Important issues regarding implementation require additional study. Future research is needed to compare outcomes of IMR consumers and active control groups and to provide a more detailed understanding of how other services utilized by consumers may affect outcomes of IMR.","McGuire, Alan B",10.1176/appi.ps.201200274,Psychiatric Services,illness management and recovery: a review of the literature.,Feb2014

METHODS Australian primary care practitioners recruited in 2009 completed case reports and collected self-report assessments from five to seven consecutively presenting patients whom they identified as having clinical depression. RESULTS Among 735 patients with clinical depression, 55% met criteria for major depressive syndrome, 86% reported clinically significant sleep disturbance, and 47% had been depressed for more than 12 months. Most (77%) were prescribed antidepressants, and 30% were prescribed anxiolytics or hypnotics. Patients under shared care with specialist mental health care providers (42%) had more severe, chronic, and recurrent conditions but no demographic advantages. CONCLUSIONS Depressed patients of general practitioners often had chronic, recurrent, and moderately to severely disabling conditions, but fewer than half received specialist care.

Findings included a high frequency of humorous responses in both groups, and an increase of humor in the art therapy group post treatment. Results suggest that image formation and artistic activity foster cognitive and creative problem solving and increased self-esteem, and that humor serves as an important therapeutic function in this population.","Kopytin, Alexander",10.1080/07421656.2013.757758,Art Therapy: Journal of the American Art Therapy Association,"humor, self-attitude, emotions, and cognitions in group art therapy with war veterans.",2013

277,"Objective: Assertive community treatment (ACT) reduces hospitalizations for persons with severe mental illness. However, not everyone who needs ACT receives it. Without empirical guidelines for ACT planning, communities are likely to underestimate or overestimate the number of teams they need; thus the capacity of the programs will not meet current needs. In this study, administrative data were used to develop empirical estimates for the number of required ACT teams. These estimates were then used to examine current conceptual guidelines for developing the number of ACT teams that communities need.Methods: Administrative data from a large, urban county were used to enumerate all persons with a severe mental illness who had three or more hospitalizations within one year (ACT eligible).Results: Fifty-one percent of persons with a severe mental illness were found to be eligible for ACT (743 of 1,453 persons). This figure represents 2.2 percent of the countys mental health users and .06 percent of its adult population.Conclusions: Communities should develop enough ACT teams to serve approximately 50 percent of their populations of persons with severe mental illness or roughly .06 percent of their adult populations.",Cuddeback GS,NLM17158499,Psychiatric Services,how many assertive community treatment teams do we need?,Dec2006

125,"Objective: To provide a review of the extant research literature on Housing First (HF) for people with severe mental illness (SMI) who are homeless and to describe the findings of the recently completed At Home (AH)-Chez soi (CS) demonstration project. HF represents a paradigm shift in the delivery of community mental health services, whereby people with SMI who are homeless are supported through assertive community treatment or intensive case management to move into regular housing. Method: The AH-CS demonstration project entailed a randomized controlled trial conducted in 5 Canadian cities between 2009 and 2013. Mixed methods were used to examine the implementation of HF programs and participant outcomes, comparing 1158 people receiving HF to 990 people receiving standard care. Results: Initial research conducted in the United States shows HF to be a promising approach, yielding superior outcomes in helping people to rapidly exit homelessness and establish stable housing. Findings from the AH-CS demonstration project reveal that HF can be successfully adapted to different contexts and for different populations without losing its fidelity. People receiving HF achieved superior housing outcomes and showed more rapid improvements in community functioning and quality of life than those receiving treatment as usual. Conclusions: Knowledge translation efforts have been undertaken to disseminate the positive findings and lessons learned from the AH-CS project and to scale up the HF approach across Canada.","Aubry, Tim",10.1177/070674371506001102,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,housing first for people with severe mental illness who are homeless: a review of the research and findings from the at home-chez soi demonstration project.,Nov2015

293,"OBJECTIVE: Homelessness and patterns of service use were examined among seriously mentally ill persons in an area with a well-funded community-based mental health system. METHODS: The sample consisted of 438 individuals referred between 1990 and 1992 to an extended acute care psychiatric hospital after a stay in a general hospital. Those experiencing an episode of homelessness, defined as an admission to a public shelter between 1990 and 1993, were compared with those who were residentially stable. Data from a longitudinal integrated database of public mental health and medical services were used to construct service utilization measures to test the mediating effect of outpatient mental health care on preventing homelessness. RESULTS: A homelessness rate of 24 percent was found among the 438 persons with serious mental illness. Those who experienced homelessness were more likely to be African American, receive general assistance, and have a comorbid substance abuse problem. They used significantly more inpatient psychiatric, emergency, and health care services than the subjects who did not become homeless. Forty to 50 percent of the homeless group received outpatient care during the year before and after their shelter episode. The number of persons who received intensive case management services increased after shelter admission. CONCLUSIONS: An enhanced community-based mental health system was not sufficient to prevent homelessness among high-risk persons with serious mental illness. Eleven percent of this group experienced homelessness after referral to an extended acute care facility. Strategies to prevent homelessness should be considered, perhaps at the time of discharge from the referring community hospital or extended acute care facility.",Kuno E,NLM10913454,Psychiatric Services,homelessness among persons with serious mental illness in an enhanced community-based mental health system.,Aug2000

72,"This study compared health status across four trauma/posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) groups of older adults with depression, anxiety, and/or at-risk drinking who attended primary care appointments (N = 1,199; mean age = 73.5 yr), mostly at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. The trauma and PTSD categories were PTSD (n = 81), partial PTSD (n = 127), trauma only (n = 323), and no trauma (n = 668). Physical and mental health-related quality of life (HQL), indices of social and economic impairment and stigma regarding treatment-seeking were compared among groups. Group differences were found for several indicators of functional impairment; the PTSD group had fewer close friends and higher treatment-seeking stigma beliefs related to having a disorder. Linear mixed modeling examined associations between trauma/PTSD group and HQL. After accounting for covariates, the trauma/PTSD groups differed across the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 scales and component scores (indicated by significant group by scale interaction). Differences among groups were confined to mental health measures; those with PTSD had worse HQL. Post hoc analyses examined the number of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses by trauma/PTSD group. Overall, findings indicate that mental HQL varies among older adults with trauma and PTSD and that although treatment-related stigma does not differ among groups, it does affect HQL.","Pless Kaiser, Anica",10.1682/JRRD.2015.03.0039,Journal of Rehabilitation Research & Development,health status and treatment-seeking stigma in older adults with trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder.,2016

Patients with depression or dysthymia were included in the study, and those who were acutely suicidal or had probable bipolar disorder were excluded. The sample of 606 patients was mainly male, white, and aged 55 or older. Health care utilization, costs, and medication data from VA administrative databases were analyzed over 12 months.Results: Patients with depression and PTSD (screen score > or =3) were more emotionally distressed, had more frequent mental health specialty visits (6.91 versus 1.68, p<.001), more total outpatient visits (26.16 versus 19.94, p<.001), and correspondingly higher outpatient mental health care costs over the previous 12 months compared with depressed patients without PTSD. Antidepressants were prescribed to a higher proportion of depressed patients with PTSD (61% versus 40%).Conclusions: Patients with PTSD and depression had greater utilization of specialty mental health treatments and antidepressant medications and higher mental health care costs in the previous 12 months than depressed patients without PTSD. As military personnel return from Iraq, both VA and non-VA health care providers need to plan for an increase in outpatient mental health services and costs, particularly among depressed veterans who also have PTSD.",Chan D,10.1176/ps.2009.60.12.1612,Psychiatric Services,health care utilization and its costs for depressed veterans with and without comorbid ptsd symptoms.,Dec2009

283,"Objective: This study estimated guideline-consistent antidepressant treatment of depression among veterans with diabetes and examined its variation by patient-level demographic characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics, access to care, and health status.Methods: Data were retrospectively analyzed from Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Medicare claims of VHA clinic users with diabetes and major depressive disorder (N=3,953). Major depression was identified by using ICD-9-CM codes 296.2 and 296.3. Incident episode was identified by using 120-day negative diagnosis and medication history on or before the first depression diagnosis date in fiscal year 1999. Guideline-consistent depression treatment was defined as the receipt of antidepressants for at least 90 days within a period of six months after the onset of depression. Chi square tests and logistic regressions were used to analyze patterns of guideline-consistent antidepressant treatment.Results: Overall, 51% received any antidepressant treatment for diagnosed major depression; among patients using any antidepressants, 62% received guideline-consistent antidepressant treatment. VHA users who received care from a mental health specialist were more likely to have guideline-consistent treatment than those who were not receiving care from a mental health specialist. African Americans, older veterans, and those with substance use disorders were less likely to have guideline-consistent antidepressant treatment.Conclusions: Guideline-consistent depression care was lower for certain subgroups of individuals. Further research is necessary to evaluate the reasons for this finding, so that targeted care coordination strategies could be developed to improve antidepressant treatment. Increased contact with mental health specialty staff, which is now being implemented in the VHA, may increase antidepressant treatment among VHA users with diabetes and major depression.",Tiwari A,10.1176/appi.ps.59.10.1139,Psychiatric Services,guideline-consistent antidepressant treatment patterns among veterans with diabetes and major depressive disorder.,Oct2008
289,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the appropriateness of and variation in intention-to-treat decisions in the management of depression in the Netherlands. DESIGN: Mailed survey with 22 paper cases (vignettes) based on a population study. SETTING: A random sample from four professional groups in the Dutch mental healthcare system. SUBJECTS: 264 general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and clinical psychologists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each vignette contained information on a number of patient characteristics taken from three national depression guidelines. The distribution of patient characteristics was based on data from a population study. Respondents were asked to choose the best treatment option and the best treatment setting. For each vignette we examined which of the selected treatments was appropriate according to the recommendations of the three published Dutch clinical guidelines and a panel of experts. RESULTS: 31% of all intention-to-treat decisions were not consistent with the guidelines. Overall, less severe depression, alcohol abuse, psychotic features, and lack of social resources were related to more inappropriate judgements. There was considerable variation between the professional groups: psychiatrists made more appropriate choices than the other professions although they had the highest rate of overtreatment. CONCLUSIONS: There is sufficient variation in the intentions to treat depression to give it priority in quality assessment and guideline development. Efforts to achieve appropriate care should focus on treatment indications, referral patterns, and overtreatment.",Tiemeier H,NLM12486983,Quality & Safety in Health Care,guideline adherence rates and interprofessional variation in a vignette study of depression.,Sep2002
292,"Background: Rates of mental health disorders are significantly greater in children with physical illnesses than in physically well children. Children with neurological conditions, such as epilepsy, are known to have particularly high rates of mental health disorders. Despite this, mental health problems in children with neurological conditions have remained under-recognised and under-treated in clinical settings. Evidence-based guided self-help interventions are efficacious in reducing symptoms of mental health disorders in children, but their efficacy in reducing symptoms of common mental health disorders in children with neurological conditions has not been investigated. We aim to pilot a guided self-help intervention for the treatment of mental health disorders in children with neurological conditions.Methods/design: A pilot randomised controlled trial with 18 patients with neurological conditions and mental health disorders will be conducted. Participants attending specialist neurology clinics at a National UK Childrens Hospital will be randomised to receive guided self-help for common mental health disorders or to a 12-week waiting list control. Participants in the treatment group will receive 10 sessions of guided self-help delivered over the telephone. The waiting list control group will receive the intervention after a waiting period of 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure is reduction in symptoms of mental health disorders. Exclusion criteria are limited to those at significant risk of harm to self or others, the presence of primary mental health disorder other than anxiety, depression or disruptive behaviour (e.g. psychosis, eating disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder) or intellectual disability at a level meaning potential participants would be unable to access the intervention. The study has ethical approval from the Camden and Islington NHS Research Ethics Committee, registration number 14.LO.1353. Results will be disseminated to patients, the wider public, clinicians and researchers through publication in journals and presentation at conferences.Discussion: This is the first study to investigate guided self-help interventions for mental health problems in children with neurological conditions, a group which is currently under-represented in mental health research. The intervention is modular and adapted from an empirically supported cognitive behavioural treatment. The generalisability and broad inclusion criteria are strengths but may also lead to some weaknesses.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN21184717 .

247,"OBJECTIVE: The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is an integral part of the standard multiaxial psychiatric diagnostic system. The purpose of including the GAF in DSM-IV as a tool for axis V assessment is to enable clinicians to obtain information about global functioning to supplement existing data about symptoms and diagnoses and to help predict the allocation and outcomes of mental health treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the value of the GAF as part of a systemwide program for monitoring the allocation and outcomes of mental health care services. METHODS: Clinicians used the GAF to assess global functioning among 9,854 patients with psychiatric or substance use disorders, or both, who were already participating in an outcomes monitoring program of the Department of Veterans Affairs. A longitudinal prospective follow-up design was used. RESULTS: Patients clinical diagnoses and symptoms were stronger predictors of GAF ratings than was their social or occupational functioning. GAF-rated impairment was associated with the provision of inpatient or residential care and outpatient psychiatric care, but patients with greater levels of impairment did not receive more treatment. GAF ratings were only minimally associated with treatment outcomes. No robust associations were found between GAF ratings and outcomes as assessed by clinician interview or by patients self-report at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Including GAF ratings in a program for predicting the allocation and outcomes of mental health care is of questionable value. Research is needed to determine whether systematic training and ongoing validity checks would enhance the contribution of the GAF in monitoring service use and outcomes.",Moos RH,NLM12045311,Psychiatric Services,global assessment of functioning ratings and the allocation and outcomes of mental health services.,Jun2002

246,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate outcomes of the Veterans Administration (VA) Afghan and Iraq Post-Deployment Screen for mental health symptoms. METHODS: Veterans Administration clinicians were encouraged to refer Iraq or Afghanistan veterans who screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, or high-risk alcohol use to a VA mental health clinic. Multivariate methods were used to determine predictors of screening, the proportions who screened positive for particular mental health problems, and predictors of VA mental health clinic attendance. RESULTS: Among 750 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who were referred to a VA medical center and 5 associated community clinics, 338 underwent postdeployment screening; 233 (69%) screened positive for mental health problems. Having been seen in primary care (adjusted odd ratio AOR=13.3; 95% confidence interval CI=8.31, 21.3) and at a VA community clinic (AOR=3.28; 95% CI=2.03, 5.28) predicted screening. African American veterans were less likely to have been screened than were White veterans (AOR=0.45; 95% CI=0.22, 0.91). Of 233 veterans who screened positive, 170 (73%) completed a mental health follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of veterans met screening criteria for co-occurring mental health problems, suggesting that the VA screens may help overcome a dont ask, dont tell climate that surrounds stigmatized mental illness.

METHODS: Patients were recruited from primary care clinics, administered the Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire, PTSD Symptom Scale, Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help-Short Form, and a survey on use of services. RESULTS: Lifetime mental health treatment was related to increased frequency of traumatic events, positive attitudes toward treatment, and probable PTSD. Recent use of mental health care and intensity of use were related to female gender and greater frequency of trauma. Regression models yielded significant associations for trauma frequency, positive treatment attitudes, and female gender. Trauma and PTSD were associated with use more than gender and treatment attitudes were.

91,"Objective: Latino families raising children with mental health and other special health care needs report greater dissatisfaction with care compared with other families. Activation is a promising strategy to eliminate disparities. This study examined the comparative effectiveness of MePrEPA, an activation intervention for Latino parents whose children receive mental health services.Methods: A randomized controlled trial (N=172) was conducted in a Spanish-language mental health clinic to assess the effectiveness of MePrEPA, a four-week group psychoeducational intervention to enhance parent activation among Latino parents, compared with a parent-support control group. Inclusion criteria were raising a child who receives services for mental health needs and ability to attend weekly sessions. Outcomes were parent activation, education activation, quality of school interaction, and parent mental health. Effectiveness of the intervention was tested with a difference-in-difference approach estimating linear mixed models. Heterogeneity of treatment effect was examined.Results: MePrEPA enhanced parent activation (?=5.98, 95% confidence interval CI=1.42-10.53), education activation (?=7.98, CI=3.01-12.94), and quality of school interaction (?=1.83, CI=.14-3.52) to a greater degree than did a parent-support control group. The interventions impact on parent activation and education outcomes was greater for participants whose children were covered by Medicaid and were novices to therapy and those with low activation at baseline. No statistically significant effects were observed in parent mental health.Conclusions: Activation among Latino parents was improved with MePrEPA, which can be readily incorporated in current practices by mental health clinics. Future work should replicate findings in a large number of sites, adding behavioral measures and distal impacts while examining MePrEPAs effects across settings and populations.","Thomas, Kathleen C.",10.1176/appi.ps.201600366,Psychiatric Services,fostering activation among latino parents of children with mental health needs: an rct.,Oct2017

METHODS Data were extracted from the New York State Office of Mental Healths Web-based outcome reporting system. ACT clients admitted between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2007 (N=4,756), were divided into three groups by their forensic status at enrollment: recent (involvement in the past six months), remote (forensic involvement was more than six months prior), and no history. Client characteristics as of ACT enrollment and outcomes at one, two, and three years were compared over time. RESULTS Clients with forensic histories had a significantly higher ongoing risk of arrest or incarceration, and those with recent criminal justice involvement had a higher risk of homelessness and early discharge from ACT. Psychiatric hospitalization rates did not differ significantly across groups. Rates of all adverse outcomes were highest in the first year for all ACT clients, especially for those with a recent forensic history, and rates of psychiatric hospitalization, homelessness, and discharge declined over time for all clients. For all ACT clients, homelessness and problematic substance abuse at enrollment were significant risk factors for arrest or incarceration and for homelessness on three-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Clients with recent forensic histories were vulnerable to an array of adverse outcomes, particularly during their first year of ACT. This finding highlights the need for additional strategies to improve forensic and other outcomes for this high-risk population.","Beach, Craig",10.1176/appi.ps.201200170,Psychiatric Services,forensic and nonforensic clients in assertive community treatment: a longitudinal study.,May2013

311,"OBJECTIVE: Persons with mental illness and/or substance abuse are frequently perceived by the public to be dangerous. This has resulted in an increase in state legislation restricting their ability to purchase, possess, register, obtain licensure, retain, and/or carry a firearm of any sort. The purpose of this article is to educate clinicians about the impact of firearms statutes and restrictions for their patients. Many state statutes mandate that treating psychiatrists report such gun possession to state justice or police departments. Psychiatrists may also have a statutory role in an appeals process. METHOD: The firearms statutes of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico and the Federal National Firearms Act were surveyed, with particular attention paid to the ability of persons with mental illness and/or alcohol or substance abuse to obtain firearms. The results were tabulated. RESULTS: These statutes are not uniform. They vary in their definition of mental illness, the type and duration of gun restriction, reporting practices, the confidentiality of medical information, and the immunity of clinician reporters and appeals processes. CONCLUSION: Clinicians would be wise to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the relevant statutes in their particular states. This will allow them to identify the consequences to their firearm-possessing patients, understand their own roles and obligations--if any--and better consider potential clinical and ethical issues for particular patients.",Norris DM,NLM16877652,American Journal of Psychiatry,"firearm laws, patients, and the roles of psychiatrists.",Aug2006

99,"Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) program on psychiatric symptoms, global functioning, life satisfaction, and recovery-promoting relationships among individuals with mental illness.Methods: Participants were patients at the Suwon Mental Health Center. Thirty-two patients were part of the ACT program and 32 patients matched for age, sex, and mental illness were in a standard case-management program and served as a control group. Follow-up with patients occurred every 3 months during the 15 months after a baseline interview. Participants completed the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale, Life Satisfaction Scale, and Recovery-Promoting Relationship Scale (RPRS).Results: No significant differences were noted in the sociodemographic characteristics of the ACT and the case-management group. According to the BPRS, the ACT group showed a significant reduction in symptom severity, but the ACT program was not significantly more effective at reducing psychiatric symptoms from baseline to the 15-month follow-up compared to the case-management approach. The ACT group showed more significant improvement than the control group in terms of the GAF Scale. Both groups showed no significant differences in the change of life satisfaction and in the change of recovery-promoting relationships. We observed a significant increase in recovery-promoting relationships in the control group, but the degree of change of recovery-promoting relationships through time flow between groups was not significantly different.Discussion: In this study, we observed that ACT was significantly better at improving the GAF than case management and that participation in ACT was associated with a significant decrease in BPRS scores. However, ACT did not demonstrate an absolute superiority over the standard case-management approach in terms of the BPRS and the measures of life satisfaction and recovery-promoting relationships.Conclusions: ACT may have some advantages over a standard case management approach.",Tae-Won Kim,10.1186/s12913-015-1058-y,BMC Health Services Research,fifteen-month follow up of an assertive community treatment program for chronic patients with mental illness.,9/16/2015

161,"OBJECTIVE A previous study of a recovery-oriented assertive community treatment initiative (PACT) in Washington State found reductions in state psychiatric hospital use and related costs for PACT participants, especially in the first six months after enrollment and for consumers who were high users of the state psychiatric hospital before ACT enrollment. This study examined whether these outcomes varied by team fidelity to recovery-oriented ACT practices. METHODS Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine the relationship between scores on the Tool for Measurement of Assertive Community Treatment (TMACT), a recently developed tool for assessing fidelity to recovery-oriented ACT, and the use of state hospitals, local hospitals, emergency departments, local crisis stabilization units, and arrests for 631 PACT consumers. These relationships were also examined for PACT consumers with any state hospital use (N=450) and those considered high users of the state hospital (>=96 days in two years before PACT enrollment). RESULTS TMACT scores were associated (p.01) with a decrease in the amount of use but not the probability of using state psychiatric hospitals, local hospital psychiatric inpatient units, and local crisis stabilization units. The marginal effects of higher TMACT scores on the probability and use of emergency departments or arrests were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS This study provides preliminary evidence for the predictive validity of the TMACT. Future research should examine the subscale structure of the TMACT as well as the association between TMACT fidelity and consumer well-being, quality of life, and other important person-centered outcomes.","Cuddeback, Gary S",10.1176/appi.ps.201200097,Psychiatric Services,fidelity to recovery-oriented act practices and consumer outcomes.,Apr2013

Twenty families (N = 39 children) with at least one HIV-positive caregiver and one child 7-17 years old were enrolled in the FSI. Children and caregivers were administered locally adapted and validated measures of child mental health problems, as well as measures of protective processes and parenting. Assessments were administered at pre and postintervention, and 6-month follow-up. Multilevel models accounting for clustering by family tested changes in outcomes of interest. Qualitative interviews were completed to understand acceptability, feasibility and satisfaction with the FSI.Results: Families reported high satisfaction with the FSI. Caregiver-reported improvements in family connectedness, good parenting, social support and childrens pro-social behaviour (P < 0.05) were sustained and strengthened from postintervention to 6-month follow-up. Additional improvements in caregiver-reported child perseverance/self-esteem, depression, anxiety and irritability were seen at follow-up (P < .05). Significant decreases in child-reported harsh punishment were observed at postintervention and follow-up, and decreases in caregiver reported harsh punishment were also recorded on follow-up (P < 0.05).Conclusion: The FSI is a feasible and acceptable intervention that shows promise for improving mental health symptoms and strengthening protective factors among children and families affected by HIV in low-resource settings.","Betancourt, Theresa S",10.1097/QAD.0000000000000336,AIDS (02699370),family-based prevention of mental health problems in children affected by hiv and aids: an open trial.,2014 Jul Suppl 3

321,"Objective: This study examined a sample of patients in Victoria, Australia, to identify factors in selection for conditional release from an initial hospitalization that occurred within 30 days of entry into the mental health system.Methods: Data were from the Victorian Psychiatric Case Register. All patients first hospitalized and conditionally released between 1990 and 2000 were identified (N=8,879), and three comparison groups were created. Two groups were hospitalized within 30 days of entering the system: those who were given conditional release and those who were not. A third group was conditionally released from a hospitalization that occurred after or extended beyond 30 days after system entry. Logistic regression identified characteristics that distinguished the first group. Ordinary least-squares regression was used to evaluate the contribution of conditional release early in treatment to reducing inpatient episodes, inpatient days, days per episode, and inpatient days per 30 days in the system.Results: Conditional release early in treatment was used for 11 percent of the sample, or more than a third of those who were eligible for this intervention. Factors significantly associated with selection for early conditional release were those related to a better prognosis (initial hospitalization at a later age and having greater than an 11th grade education), a lower likelihood of a diagnosis of dementia or schizophrenia, involuntary status at first inpatient admission, and greater community involvement (being employed and being married). When the analyses controlled for these factors, use of conditional release early in treatment was significantly associated with a reduction in use of subsequent inpatient care.",Segal SP,NLM17085610,Psychiatric Services,factors in the selection of patients for conditional release from their first psychiatric hospitalization.,Nov2006
251,"Objective: This study analyzed use of services from psychiatrists and other mental health professionals (psychologists, psychotherapists, counselors, and social workers) in six European countries.Methods: Data were from respondents (N=8,796) to the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD), a cross-sectional survey (2001-2003) of a representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain that was conducted via computer-assisted interviews with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 3.0.Results: Twenty-three percent of respondents reported lifetime use of any professional for mental health problems, and 60% consulted a mental health provider. Among these, 56% used a psychiatrist and 68% used a nonpsychiatrist provider. Factors associated with use of psychiatrists only were being retired or unemployed, having 12 or fewer years of education, living in France or Spain, having a severe disorder, and using psychotropic medication. Factors associated with use of nonpsychiatrist providers only were living in the Netherlands or Germany, never being married, and having an anxiety disorder.Conclusions: The findings suggest that there is no simple model of associations between mental health care system and patterns of service use. System characteristics, such as practitioner-population ratios, levels of practitioner availability, and gatekeeping and reimbursement policies, affect patterns of use of mental health providers. Recent British and Australian plans could be used as models for better allocation of services in some ESEMeD countries.",Dezetter A,10.1176/ps.62.2.pss6202_0143,Psychiatric Services,factors associated with use of psychiatrists and nonpsychiatrist providers by esemed respondents in six european countries.,Feb2011
337,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined patterns of mental health service use among depressed children and adolescents and factors associated with help seeking and treatment modalities. METHODS: The sample consisted of 206 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years who were assessed as part of a larger survey of mental health service use in five service systems and in the community and who met DSM-III-R criteria for depressive disorders (major depression or dysthymia). RESULTS: Among the 206 children, 75 (36 percent) never received professional help for depressive symptoms. Among the 131 children who received professional help for depression, antidepressants were prescribed for 40 (31 percent) in the year before the interview. The findings indicate possible undertreatment of depression among children and adolescents, especially among African Americans. Socioeconomic factors, such as the mothers education and the childs health insurance, were not associated with receiving professional help for depressive symptoms but were associated with receiving antidepressants. Parental perception of a childs mental health service need was associated with receiving professional help but not with receiving antidepressants. Also, depressed children were more likely to receive antidepressants when they had life-threatening or severe symptoms, such as a suicide attempt or drug abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Whether a depressed child receives mental health services and the types of treatment received are influenced by different individual and family factors and by the type of symptoms exhibited. Better understanding of these factors will help in meeting the service needs of depressed children and adolescents.",Wu P,NLM11157117,Psychiatric Services,factors associated with use of mental health services for depression by children and adolescents.,Feb2001

301,"Objectives: Watchful waiting to manage depression in primary care may be an appropriate management approach for some patients who present with less severe depression. This study examined factors associated with primary care clinicians choice of a watchful waiting approach to care management for depression.Methods: Secondary data were analyzed from Partners in Care, which examined dissemination of best practices for depression in primary care. Primary care clinicians decisions regarding watchful waiting were examined by using the baseline survey data from Partners in Care completed by clinicians and patients from February 1996 to March 1997. Participants were 167 primary care clinicians from 46 practices of seven managed care organizations across the United States and their 1,187 patients with depression. Primary care clinicians proclivity for watchful waiting was examined by using a brief scenario describing a patient with major depressive disorder.Results: Thirty-four clinicians (20 percent) reported a strong proclivity to use watchful waiting for the patient in the scenario. The proclivity was significantly associated with clinicians reports of the proportion of their actual patients with whom they used this approach. Clinicians were significantly more likely to choose watchful waiting for their actual patients if they had more psychotherapy knowledge (p=.035) or perceived that the need to treat the patients medical illness was more important than the need to treat his or her mental illness (p=.046) and were less likely to choose a watchful waiting approach if they perceived the lack of availability of mental health professionals as a barrier (p=.050).Conclusions: Primary care clinicians knowledge of treatment and perception of barriers influence their proclivity for watchful waiting.

87,"Objective: Psychiatric advance directives (PADs) provide a legal mechanism for competent adults to document care preferences and authorize a surrogate to make treatment decisions. In a controlled research setting, an evidence-based intervention, the facilitated psychiatric advance directive (FPAD), was previously shown to overcome most barriers to PAD completion. This study examined implementation of the FPAD intervention in usual care settings as delivered by peer support specialists and nonpeer clinicians on assertive community treatment (ACT) teams.Methods: A total of 145 ACT consumers were randomly assigned, within teams, to FPAD with facilitation by either a peer (N=71) or a clinician (N=74). Completion rates and PAD quality were compared with the previous studys standard and across facilitator type. Logistic regression was used to estimate effects on the likelihood of PAD completion.Results: The completion rate of 50% in the intent-to-treat sample (N=145) was somewhat inferior to the prior standard (61%), but the rate of 58% for the retained sample (those who completed a follow-up interview, N=116) was not significantly different from the standard. Rates for peers and clinicians did not differ significantly from each other for either sample. PAD quality was similar to that achieved in the prior study. Four consumer variables predicted completion: independent living status, problematic substance use, length of time served by the ACT team, and no perceived unmet need for hospitalization in crisis.Conclusions: Peers and clinicians can play a crucial role in increasing the number of consumers with PADs, an important step toward improving implementation of PADs in mental health care.","Easter, Michele M.",10.1176/appi.ps.201600423,Psychiatric Services,facilitation of psychiatric advance directives by peers and clinicians on assertive community treatment teams.,Jul2017

355,"Motivational interviewing (MI) was originally developed for the treatment of substance abuse but is rapidly expanding to other major mental health populations beyond addictions. This brief review considers the use of MI and related motivational enhancement therapies (METs) in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and eating disorders, and concurrent psychosis and substance use disorders. MI-MET has been added and (or) integrated into treatment for these problems in a wide variety of ways, most commonly as a pretreatment to other therapies (psychosocial treatments and pharmacotherapy) or integrated into standard assessment procedures. In each problem domain, the bulk of the current evidence supports the value of adding MI to existing therapies in increasing engagement with treatment and in improving clinical outcomes. This is particularly encouraging in that many of the populations included in these investigations represent severe and treatment-recalcitrant populations. However, research on the application of MI to other major mental health problems beyond addictions is in the early stages, with existing studies having numerous limitations (for example, small uncontrolled studies or lack of adequate control groups, and failure to establish both MI treatment integrity and the unique contribution of MI in integrated treatments). In short, the substantial body of promising preliminary findings strongly support the continued investigation of MI and related methods for these populations in well-designed clinical trials that examine not only the additive value of MI but also mechanisms underlying these effects and individual differences (moderators) indicating the need for MI.",Westra HA,NLM22114918,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,extending motivational interviewing to the treatment of major mental health problems: current directions and evidence.,Nov2011

88,"Background: The way in which pragmatic trials are designed suggests that there are differences between the experiences of participants randomised to usual care and intervention arms. These potential differences relate not only to which treatment participants receive but also how they access and engage with their allocated treatment. Such differences could affect trial results. The aim of this study was to assess whether such differences exist and, if they do, to consider their implications for the design of future trials.Methods: Interview transcripts were sampled from data sets gathered during three qualitative studies, all of which had been nested within large, primary care depression trials. Each study had explored trial participants views and experiences of treatments received following randomisation. Transcripts from 37 participants were purposefully sampled, 20 of which were from interviews held with individuals allocated to receive usual GP care. Data were analysed thematically.Results: There was evidence of differences between trial arms across all three data sets. Intervention participants were willing and able to engage with the treatment to which they had been allocated. Randomisation had led to them embarking upon a clear treatment pathway and receiving care in a context where they felt comfortable discussing their mental health and had sufficient time to do so. Intervention participants also had continuity with and confidence in the practitioners they saw. A few usual-care participants talked about having continuity with and confidence in their GPs. However, most of the usual-care participants reported a reluctance to consult GPs about mental health, difficulties in securing treatment appointments, and little or no changes in care following randomisation. Additionally, most reported a lack of continuity of care and a lack confidence in the treatment available to them.Conclusions: There are important differences between usual-care and intervention arms that go beyond treatment received, and they relate to how participants experience accessing and engaging with their allocated care. As these differences could affect trial results, researchers may want to measure or reduce them in order to fully appreciate or control for the range of factors that might affect treatment outcomes.","Turner, Katrina M.",10.1186/s13063-017-2030-4,Trials,exploring patients treatment journeys following randomisation in mental health trials to improve future trial conduct: a synthesis of multiple qualitative data sets.,6/15/2017

148,"Background: The mental health-care system in Sweden, as in many other counties, has its main focus on the reduction of psychiatric symptoms and the prevention of relapses. People diagnosed with schizophrenia often have significant health issues and experience reduced well-being in everyday life. The social imaginary of mental illness as an imbalance of the brain has implications concerning general attitudes in society. The news media are an important source of information on psychiatric disorders and have an important role in cultivating public perceptions and stigma. News media can contribute to the mental illness stigma and place individuals with mental illnesses at risk of not receiving adequate care and support. The aim of this preliminary study was to describe users experiences of housing support in everyday life. Results: The results revealed three themes of housing support, which were needed, but frequently insufficiently fulfilled in the municipality. The three themes were: ""Support to Practice Healthy Routines in Daily Life,"" ""Support to Shape Meaningful Contents in Everyday Life,"" and ""Support to Meet Needs of Integrity and Respect."" Conclusions: The findings support previous studies arguing that current health care and housing support fails to meet basic needs and may lead to significant and unnecessary health risks. Further investigation is needed regarding the links between attitudes to mental illness in society and political and financial principles for health care and housing support for persons with schizophrenia. Further research is needed regarding the role of the media in policymaking concerning health promotion interventions for people diagnosed with schizophrenia.","Jormfeldt, Henrika",10.3402/qhw.v11.30571,International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health & Well-Being,experiences of housing support in everyday life for persons with schizophrenia and the role of the media from a societal perspective.,2016

Regression analyses were used to determine the respective impact of PTSD, and self-reported symptoms of MDD, GAD, AUD, and anxiety on suicidal ideation.Results: Most people met PCL-M screening criteria for PTSD (73.6%, n = 184), while 70.8% (n = 177) screened positively for a probable major depressive episode. PTSD symptom was significantly associated with suicidal ideation (? = 0.412, P < 0.001). After controlling for self-reported depressive symptom severity, AUD severity, and generalized anxiety, PTSD severity was no longer significantly associated with suicidal ideation (? = 0.043, P = 0.58).Conclusions: Although PTSD alone is associated with suicidal ideation, after controlling for common comorbid psychiatric illnesses, self-reported depressive symptom severity emerged as the most significant predictor of suicidal ideation. These findings support the importance of screening for comorbidities, particularly an MDD, as potentially modifiable conditions that are strongly related to suicidal ideation in military personnels endorsing criteria for PTSD.",Richardson JD,NLM22854032,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,examining the association between psychiatric illness and suicidal ideation in a sample of treatment-seeking canadian peacekeeping and combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd.,Aug2012

151,"Background: Most research on interventions to counter stigma and discrimination has focused on short-term outcomes and has been conducted in high-income settings.Aims: To synthesise what is known globally about effective interventions to reduce mental illness-based stigma and discrimination, in relation first to effectiveness in the medium and long term (minimum 4 weeks), and second to interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Method: We searched six databases from 1980 to 2013 and conducted a multi-language Google search for quantitative studies addressing the research questions. Effect sizes were calculated from eligible studies where possible, and narrative syntheses conducted. Subgroup analysis compared interventions with and without social contact.Results: Eighty studies (n = 422 653) were included in the review. For studies with medium or long-term follow-up (72, of which 21 had calculable effect sizes) median standardised mean differences were 0.54 for knowledge and -0.26 for stigmatising attitudes. Those containing social contact (direct or indirect) were not more effective than those without. The 11 LMIC studies were all from middle-income countries. Effect sizes were rarely calculable for behavioural outcomes or in LMIC studies.Conclusions: There is modest evidence for the effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions beyond 4 weeks follow-up in terms of increasing knowledge and reducing stigmatising attitudes. Evidence does not support the view that social contact is the more effective type of intervention for improving attitudes in the medium to long term. Methodologically strong research is needed on which to base decisions on investment in stigma-reducing interventions.","Mehta, N.",10.1192/bjp.bp.114.151944,British Journal of Psychiatry,evidence for effective interventions to reduce mental health-related stigma and discrimination in the medium and long term: systematic review.,Nov2015

363,"Background: Recent studies in North American contexts have suggested that the Housing First model is a promising strategy for providing effective services to homeless people with mental illness. In the context of the highly generous French national health and social care system, which is easily accessible and does not require out-of-pocket payment, the French Health Ministry insists on rigorous techniques, including randomized protocols, to evaluate the impact of Housing First approaches in France.Method and Design: A prospective randomized trial was designed to assess the impact of a Housing First intervention on health outcomes and costs over a period of 24 months on homeless people with severe mental illness, compared to Treatment-As-Usual. The study is being conducted in four cities in France: Lille, Marseille, Paris and Toulouse. The inclusion criteria are as follows: over 18 years of age, absolutely homeless or in precarious housing, and possessing a high level of need: diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and moderate to severe disability according to the Multnomah Community Ability Scale (score ? 62) and at least one of the following three criteria: 1) having been hospitalized for mental illness two or more times in any one year during the preceding five years; 2) co-morbid alcohol or substance use; and 3) having been recently arrested or incarcerated. Participants will be randomized to receiving the Housing First intervention or Treatment-As-Usual. The Housing First intervention provides immediate access to independent housing and community care. The primary outcome criterion is the use of high-cost health services (that is,, number of hospital admissions and number of emergency department visits) during the 24-month follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures include health outcomes, social functioning, housing stability and contact with police services. An evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of Housing First will also be conducted. A total of 300 individuals per group will be included.Discussion: This is the first study to examine the impact of a Housing First intervention compared to Treatment-As-Usual in France. It should provide key information to policymakers concerning the cost-effectiveness and health outcomes of the Housing First model in the French context.Trial Registration: The current clinical trial number is NCT01570712.","Tinland, Aurelie",10.1186/1745-6215-14-309,Trials,evaluation of the housing first program in patients with severe mental disorders in france: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,2013

METHODS: Program participants were invited to respond to an online survey developed for this study; 46% (N=121) responded. RESULTS: Two-thirds of survey respondents had engaged in mentoring program activities ten or more times in the past six months. Roughly half the respondents reported that the program helped them be more connected to other clinics, learn about innovations in care, and feel more supported. Those who participated more often (beta=.25, p.01) and rated their mentors highly (beta=.59, p.01) reported greater benefits from the program. CONCLUSIONS: Mentees who were actively engaged with the mentoring program reported significant benefits.

74,"Background: People with a mental illness experience a greater morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases relative to the general population. A higher prevalence of modifiable health risk behaviours such as smoking, poor nutrition, physical inactivity and harmful alcohol consumption contribute substantially to this disparity. Despite clinical practice guidelines recommending that mental health services routinely provide care to address these risk behaviours, the provision of such care is consistently reported to be low internationally and in Australia. This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial that aims to assess the effectiveness of allocating a clinician within a community mental health service to the specific role of providing assessment, advice and referral for clients chronic disease risk behaviours.Methods/design: Approximately 540 clients of one community mental health service will be randomised to receive either usual care for chronic disease risks provided in routine consultations or usual care plus an additional face-to-face consultation and follow-up telephone call with a healthy lifestyle clinician. The clinician will assess clients chronic disease risk behaviours, provide advice to change behaviours, and refer at-risk clients to free telephone coaching services (New South Wales (NSW) Quitline and NSW Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service) for specialist behaviour change care. The primary outcomes, regarding referral to and client uptake of the telephone services, will be obtained from the respective services. Telephone interviews of clients at baseline and at 1 and 6 months post baseline follow-ups will assess secondary outcomes: receipt of any assessment, advice and referral from the mental health service; satisfaction with the receipt of such care; satisfaction with the receipt of any care provided by the telephone services; interest and confidence in and perceived importance of changing risk behaviours; and risk behaviour status.Discussion: This study will add to the limited literature regarding effective strategies to address chronic disease prevention among the higher risk population of community mental health clients. The results will inform the development of future policies and service delivery initiatives to address the high prevalence of chronic disease risk behaviours among people with a mental illness.Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), ACTRN12616001519448 .

117,"Objective: This study investigated whether higher attendance in a skills-based group therapy program designed for inmates was associated with fewer rule infractions as reflected in the number of disciplinary reports received in a state correctional system.Methods: Administrative data were provided by the Connecticut Department of Correction and Correctional Managed Health Care at UConn Health, the systems health care organization. This was a retrospective cohort analysis of START NOW program participation events from 2010 through 2013 (N=946). Participants were adult male and female inmates, both sentenced and unsentenced, with and without recorded psychiatric diagnoses. The number of disciplinary reports was documented for up to six months after program participation. Incident rate ratios are presented from zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. Predictive margins examined variation in the effect of sessions attended on disciplinary reports in the postprogram period across security risk groups and primary psychiatric diagnosis groups.Results: For each additional session of START NOW completed, a 5% reduction was noted in the incident rate of disciplinary reports. The effect of program participation was robust to all model considerations. Inmates with higher overall security scores appear to benefit most from program participation. The program was also found to be effective across primary psychiatric diagnosis classifications.Conclusions: START NOW was shown to be an effective treatment option for reducing disciplinary infractions by inmates.","Kersten, Linda",10.1176/appi.ps.201400471,Psychiatric Services,evaluating start now: a skills-based psychotherapy for inmates of correctional systems.,Jan2016

78,"Background: The impact of humanitarian disasters upon mental health is well recognised. The evidence for psychological interventions for mental health is mounting, but few interventions have been rigorously tested in humanitarian settings. To be sustainable in humanitarian settings interventions need to be short, simple, deliverable by nonspecialists under supervision, and adopt a transdiagnostic approach where an array of mental health outcomes are addressed simultaneously. These elements have been incorporated into the newly developed WHO Problem Management Plus (PM+) Group intervention. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the locally adapted PM+ Group intervention for women in Swat, Pakistan.Methods: This PM+ Group trial is a two-arm, single-blind, cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in a community-based setting with women in rural Pakistan. PM+ is delivered in partnership with the Lady Health Worker (LHW) Programme which provides community-based health care to women in Pakistan. Thirty-four LHW clusters will be randomised in a 1:1 allocation ratio using a permuted-block randomisation method. Participants screened and found to meet the inclusion criteria will be allocated to either the PM+ intervention group (n?=?306), or the control arm (n?=?306). The manualised PM+ intervention involves five sessions, each lasting 3 h, and introduces four strategies applied by participants to problems that they are facing. It is delivered by local female facilitators with a minimum of 16 years of education who are provided with targeted training and supervision. The primary outcome is individual psychological distress, measured by levels of anxiety and depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 20 weeks after baseline. Secondary outcomes include major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, levels of social support, levels of functioning, and economic effectiveness. Intervention acceptability will be explored through an embedded qualitative study.Discussion: The PM+ Group trial will provide important evidence on the effectiveness of an empirically supported psychological treatment delivered by nonspecialists in a humanitarian setting. If proven effective, the qualitative component will inform strategies for PM+ Group scale-up in health systems in other humanitarian settings.Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, identifier: ACTRN12616000037404.

107,"Background: Many people with mental distress are disadvantaged because care is not available or does not address their needs. In order to increase access to high quality primary mental health care for under-served groups, we created a model of care with three discrete elements: community engagement, primary care training and tailored wellbeing interventions. We have previously demonstrated the individual impact of each element of the model. Here we assess the effectiveness of the combined model in increasing access to and improving the quality of primary mental health care. We test the assumptions that access to the wellbeing interventions is increased by the presence of community engagement and primary care training; and that quality of primary mental health care is increased by the presence of community engagement and the wellbeing interventions.Methods: We implemented the model in four under-served localities in North-West England, focusing on older people and minority ethnic populations. Using a quasi-experimental design with no-intervention comparators, we gathered a combination of quantitative and qualitative information. Quantitative information, including referral and recruitment rates for the wellbeing interventions, and practice referrals to mental health services, was analysed descriptively. Qualitative information derived from interview and focus group responses to topic guides from more than 110 participants. Framework analysis was used to generate findings from the qualitative data.Results: Access to the wellbeing interventions was associated with the presence of the community engagement and the primary care training elements. Referrals to the wellbeing interventions were associated with community engagement, while recruitment was associated with primary care training. Qualitative data suggested that the mechanisms underlying these associations were increased awareness and sense of agency. The quality of primary mental health care was enhanced by information gained from our community mapping activities, and by the offer of access to the wellbeing interventions. There were variable benefits from health practitioner participation in community consultative groups. We also found that participation in the wellbeing interventions led to increased community engagement.Conclusions: We explored the interactions between elements of a multilevel intervention and identified important associations and underlying mechanisms. Further research is needed to test the generalisability of the model.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials, reference ISRCTN68572159 .

Part of the TTC evaluation consists of an annual national phone survey of mental health service users. Participants (537 in 2008 and 1,047 in 2009) were current outpatient service users aged 18-65 registered with National Health Service community mental health teams that are selected annually to represent the range of socioeconomic deprivation. Telephone interviews were conducted with service users with the Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC) to document experienced discrimination and anticipated discrimination in the past 12 months.Results: One or more experiences of discrimination were reported by 9-1% of participants in 2008 and 87% of participants in 2009 (p = .03). In 2009 significantly less discrimination was reported from a number of common sources, including family (reported by 53% in 2008 and 46% in 2009), friends (53% and 39%), finding employment (24% and 16%), and keeping employment (from 17% to 13%).

194,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to comprehensively review published literature about strategies to reduce self-stigma among people with mental illness. Recommendations and implications for research also are discussed. METHODS: The electronic databases of Ovid, PubMed, and PsycINFO were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 and August 2011 by using the key words self-stigma, internalized stigma, perceived stigma, and stigma intervention. The search was further narrowed to studies that described a detailed intervention and that used self-stigma as a primary or secondary outcome, tested the intervention among individuals with a psychiatric illness, and analyzed data quantitatively with acceptable statistical tools. RESULTS: Fourteen articles met inclusion criteria, and eight reported significant improvement in self-stigma outcomes. Participants predominantly had schizophrenia and related disorders or depression. Six self-stigma reduction strategies were identified. Psychoeducation was the most frequently tested intervention. Self-stigma definitions, measurements, and conceptual frameworks varied considerably across these studies. Several studies lacked a theoretical framework for their intervention. Six different scales were used to measure self-stigma. CONCLUSIONS: Two prominent approaches for self-stigma reduction emerged from our review: one, interventions that attempt to alter the stigmatizing beliefs and attitudes of the individual; and two, interventions that enhance skills for coping with self-stigma through improvements in self-esteem, empowerment, and help-seeking behavior. The second approach seems to have gained traction among stigma experts. Targeting high-risk groups to preempt self-stigma appears to be a promising area for future research.",Mittal D,NLM22855130,Psychiatric Services,empirical studies of self-stigma reduction strategies: a critical review of the literature.,Oct2012

224,"OBJECTIVE: A randomized cluster controlled trial tested the hypothesis that weekly feedback to clinicians would improve the effectiveness of home-based mental health treatment received by youths in community settings. METHODS: Youths, caregivers, and clinicians at 28 sites in ten states completed assessments of the youths symptoms and functioning every other week. Clinicians at 13 sites were provided with weekly feedback about the assessments, and clinicians at 15 sites received feedback every 90 days. Data were collected from June 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008. Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted with hierarchical linear modeling of data provided by youths, caregivers, and clinicians. RESULTS: Assessments by youths, caregivers, and clinicians indicated that youths (N=173) treated at sites where clinicians could receive weekly feedback improved faster than youths (N=167) treated at sites where clinicians did not receive weekly feedback. A dose-response analysis showed even stronger effects when clinicians viewed more feedback reports. CONCLUSIONS: Routine measurement and feedback can be used to improve outcomes for youths who receive typical home-based services in the community.

The objective of this study was to determine whether Housing First increases the odds of obtaining competitive employment in this population and affects income, including income from informal and illegal sources.Methods: A total of 2,148 people with a mental illness were recruited from five Canadian cities while they were homeless, classified as having moderate or high needs, and randomly assigned to Housing First or usual care. Housing First participants with high needs received assertive community treatment (ACT), and those with moderate needs received intensive case management (ICM). Every three months, participants were interviewed about employment and earnings in the previous months (median follow-up=745 days). Regression models were estimated via generalized estimating equations.Results: ICM recipients had lower odds of obtaining employment compared with the control group with moderate needs. The odds of obtaining employment among ICM recipients increased but their employment rate never exceeded that of the control group. For ACT recipients, the odds of obtaining employment were not significantly different from those of the control group. Among Housing First participants, persons employed at baseline, men, and younger participants had greater odds of employment compared with control participants. Housing First did not appear to significantly increase income.Conclusions: This was the first large-scale randomized controlled study of Housing Firsts effects on employment. Further research is needed to determine how Housing First may be enhanced to increase odds of obtaining employment.","Poremski, Daniel",10.1176/appi.ps.201500002,Psychiatric Services,effects of housing first on employment and income of homeless individuals: results of a randomized trial.,Jun2016

339,"OBJECTIVE: The study examined the effectiveness of an outreach intervention designed to increase access to mental health treatment among veterans disabled by chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and identified patient-reported barriers to care associated with failure to seek the treatment offered. METHODS: Participants were 594 male Vietnam veterans who were not enrolled in mental health care at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center but who were receiving VA disability benefits for PTSD. Half the sample was randomly assigned to an outreach intervention, and the other half was assigned to a control group. Veterans in the intervention group received a mailing that included a brochure describing PTSD treatment available at an urban VA medical center, along with a letter informing them about how to access care. Participants in the intervention group were subsequently telephoned by a study coordinator who encouraged them to enroll in PTSD treatment and who administered a survey assessing barriers to care. RESULTS: Veterans in the intervention group were significantly more likely than those in the control group to schedule an intake appointment (28 percent versus 7 percent), attend the intake (23 percent versus 7 percent), and enroll in treatment (19 percent versus 6 percent). Several patient-identified barriers were associated with failure to seek VA mental health care, such as personal obligations that prevented clinic attendance, inconvenient clinic hours, and current receipt of mental health treatment from a non-VA provider. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of mental health services among underserved veterans with PTSD can be increased by an inexpensive outreach intervention, which may be useful with other chronically mentally ill populations.",McFall M,NLM10686246,Psychiatric Services,effects of an outreach intervention on use of mental health services by veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder.,Mar2000

371,"Background: Although Primary Health Care (PHC) Teams are used to deal with prevention and treatment of sanitary problems in adults with chronic diseases, they usually have a lack of experience in development of psychotherapeutic interventions. However, these interventions are the ones that achieve better results to reduce symptomatology and improve emotional state of caregivers.The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention of psychotherapy in improving the mental health and Quality of life of caregivers. This intervention is based on theoretical approaches to care adjusted to cognitive theory, in order to be applied in primary health care centres.Methods/design: This is multicentre clinical trials study, randomized in two parallel groups, carry out in two PHC, Study population: 150 caregivers will be included by consecutive sampling and they will be randomized the half to experimental group and the other half to control group. They provide mostly all the assistance to care-dependent familiars receiving attention in PHC Centers.Measurements: Each caregiver will be evaluated on a personal interview. The caregivers assessment protocol: 1) Assessment of different socio-demographic related to care, and caregivers personal situation. 2)Care-dependent individuals will also be assessed by Barthel Index and Pfeiffer Questionnaire (SPMSQ). 3)Change in caregivers will be the principal measure: family function (Family APGAR Questionnaire), burden short questionnaire (Short Zarit Burden Interview), quality of life (Ruiz & Baca: 1993 Questionnaire), the Duke-UNK Functional Social Support Questionnaire, the General Health Questionnaire-12, and changes in Dysfunctional Thoughts about caring. 4) Intervention implementation measures will also be assessed.Intervention: A psychotherapeutic intervention will be 8 sessions of 90 minutes in groups. This intervention has been initially developed for family caregivers of patients with dementia.Discussion: Psychotherapeutic interventions have been proved to obtain better results to reduce symptomatology and improve emotional state of caregivers. Moreover, this intervention has been proved to be effective in a different setting other than PHC, and was developed by professionals of Mental Health. If we found that this intervention is effective in PHC and with our professionals, it would be an important instrument to offer to caregivers of care-dependent patients.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01177696.",Rodríguez-Sánchez E,10.1186/1471-2458-10-559,BMC Public Health,effectiveness of an intervention in groups of family caregivers of dependent patients for their application in primary health centers. study protocol.,2010

Method: A 24-month, multicentre, randomized controlled trial was used to compare the results of PR to care as usual (CAU). Patients with SMI were randomly assigned by a central randomization centre to PR (n = 80) or CAU (n = 76). The primary outcome of goal attainment was assessed by independent raters blind to treatment allocation. Measures for secondary outcomes were change in work situation and independent living, the Personal Empowerment Scale, the Camberwell Assessment of Needs, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment. Effects were tested at 12 and 24 months. Data were analyzed according to intention to treat. Covariates were psychiatric centre, psychopathology, number of care contacts, and educational level of the professionals involved. Results: The rate of goal attainment was substantially higher in PR at 24 months (adjusted risk difference: 21%, 95% CI 4% to 38%; number needed to treat NNT = 5). The approach was also more effective in the area of societal participation (PR: 21% adjusted increase, CAU: 0% adjusted increase; NNT = 5) but not in the other secondary outcome measures. Conclusions: The results suggest that PR is effective in supporting patients with SMI to reach self-formulated rehabilitation goals and in enhancing societal participation, although no effects were found on the measures of functioning, need for care, and quality of life.",Swildens W,NLM22152644,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,effectively working on rehabilitation goals: 24-month outcome of a randomized controlled trial of the boston psychiatric rehabilitation approach.,Dec2011

Both groups received appointment dates on appointment cards, and the intervention group also received SMS text reminders of their appointments. Proportion of missed next appointments was the primary outcome measured.Results: A total of 192 patients were included in a per-protocol analysis. A majority of them were single and cared for by a first-degree relative. The mean±SD age of the patients was 33.7±11.9 years. The median duration of untreated psychosis was 12 weeks, and the mean score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was 47.3±12.9 (possible scores range from 13 to 168). Participants who received the SMS reminders were almost twice as likely to attend their appointment compared with the control group. After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables, the analysis showed that receiving an SMS reminder independently reduced the risk of a missed next appointment by 50%.Conclusions: SMS reminders of appointments were an effective intervention to improve clinic attendance among persons treated for first-episode psychosis at the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital in Benin City, Nigeria.","Thomas, Ibironke Felicia",10.1176/appi.ps.201500514,Psychiatric Services,effect of short message service reminders on clinic attendance among outpatients with psychosis at a psychiatric hospital in nigeria.,Jan2017

Moreover, children of mothers with mental health problems enter treatment with more severe symptomatology than do other children. However, little is known about how maternal mental health problems affect childrens response to treatment. This study examined the impact of maternal mental health status on the childs treatment response. METHODS: The mental health of 272 mother-child pairs was assessed twice, when children entered treatment at three community mental health clinics and again three months later. Analysis of variance was used to examine the impact of maternal mental health status on childrens rate of improvement. RESULTS: Children of mothers with mental health problems had significantly greater behavior problems (F=34.54, p<.001) and demonstrated less improvement over time (F=4.44, p=.04) than children of mentally healthy mothers.

This study reports changes in dental health and oral care needs of psychiatric inpatients after 1998, when psychiatric hospitals in Israel were required to provide regular dental examinations and treatment for every inpatient hospitalized longer than a year.Methods: Two epidemiological cohorts from 1997 and 2006 representing long-term psychiatric inpatients before (N=431) and after (N=254) the reform of dental services were compared on the standardized criteria of the Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT) index scores and DMFT component scores, as well as on the use of and need for dentures.Results: Compared with the prereform cohort, the postreform cohort had fewer decayed teeth and lower DMFT index scores. These differences were independent of gender and clinical diagnosis. No between-cohort differences were found in the use of and need for dentures. On-site dental services were more effective than outsourced services in improving dental health.Conclusions: The results suggest a substantial improvement in the dental health of this at-risk population after the dental reform in psychiatric hospitals.

356,"Background: High levels of emotional distress in cancer patients often goes unnoticed in daily clinical routine, resulting in severe undertreatment of mental health problems in this patient group. Screening tools can be used to increase case identification, however, screening alone does not necessarily translate into better mental health for the patient. Doctors play a key role in providing basic emotional support and transferring the patients in need of such specific support to mental health professionals. This study investigates whether a stepped care model, combining screening, doctor consultation and professional psycho-oncological service in a structured way, improves the emotional wellbeing of cancer patients.Methods/design: This study is a cluster randomized trial with two parallel groups (intervention vs. care as usual), set in an academic hospital. Participants are cancer patients, a total of 1,000 at baseline. The intervention consists of stepped psychosocial care. Step one: screening for distress, step two: feedback of screening results to the doctor in charge of the patient and consultation with the patient, and step three: based on a shared patient-doctor decision, either transferal to the consultation liaison (CL) service or not. The outcome will be emotional well-being half a year after baseline, ascertained with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Randomization will be done by the cluster randomization of wards.Discussion: Mental health problems not only cause emotional suffering but also direct and indirect costs. This calls for timely and adequate psychosocial support, especially as we know that such support is effective. However, not every cancer patient can and must be treated by a mental health professional. Allocating limited resources most sensibly and economically is of crucial importance for our healthcare system to ensure the best quality of care to as many patients as possible. It is the hope of the STEPPED CARE trial that this model is both effective and efficient, and that it can be implemented in other hospitals as well, if proven to be effective.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials Register (Clinicaltrials.gov) identifier: NCT01859429 registration date 17 May 2013.","Singer, Susanne",10.1186/1745-6215-15-482,Trials,effect of a structured psycho-oncological screening and treatment model on mental health in cancer patients (stepped care): study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial.,2014

335,"Background: Faced with a life-threatening illness, such as cancer, many patients develop stress symptoms, i.e. avoidance behaviour, intrusive thoughts and worry. Stress management interventions have proven to be effective; however, they are mostly performed in group settings and it is commonly breast cancer patients who are studied. We hereby present the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an individual stress-management intervention with a stepped-care approach in several cancer diagnoses.Method: Patients (? 18 years) with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, prostate cancer or testicle cancer and scheduled for adjuvant/curative oncology treatment, will consecutively be included in the study. In this prospective longitudinal intervention study with a stepped-care approach, patients will be randomized to control, treatment as usual, or an individual stress-management intervention in two steps. The first step is a low-intensity stress-management intervention, given to all patients randomized to intervention. Patients who continue to report stress symptoms after the first step will thereafter be given more intensive treatment at the second step of the programme. In the intervention patients will also be motivated to be physically active. Avoidance and intrusion are the primary outcomes. According to the power analyses, 300 patients are planned to be included in the study and will be followed for two years. Other outcomes are physical activity level, sleep duration and quality recorded objectively, and anxiety, depression, quality of life, fatigue, stress in daily living, and patient satisfaction assessed using valid and standardized psychometric tested questionnaires. Utilization of hospital services will be derived from the computerized patient administration systems used by the hospital. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated through a cost-utility analysis.Discussion: This RCT will provide empirical evidence of whether an individually administered stress-management programme in two steps can decrease stress as well as maintain or enhance patients physical activity level, quality of life and psychological well-being. Further, this RCT, with a stepped-care approach, will provide knowledge regarding the cost-effectiveness of an individually administered stress-management programme whose aim is to help and support individual patients at the right level of care.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT 01588262.","Arving, Cecilia",10.1186/1471-2407-13-9,BMC Cancer,early rehabilitation of cancer patients - a randomized controlled intervention study.,2013

In recent years, e-mental health interventions using clinical video teleconferencing, Internet-based interventions, social networking sites, and telephones have emerged as viable, cost-effective methods to augment traditional service delivery. Whereas some research evaluates attitudes about e-mental health, few studies have assessed interest in using these approaches in a contemporary sample of U.S. Veterans. This study sought to understand willingness to use e-mental health in a diverse group of Veterans residing in Hawaii. Mailed surveys were completed by 600 Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom Veterans and National Guard members. Results suggest that overall willingness to use e-mental health ranged from 32.2% to 56.7% depending on modality type. Importantly, Veterans who screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were significantly less likely to report willingness to use each e-mental health modality than their peers without PTSD, despite their greater desire for mental health services. These results suggest that despite solutions to logistical barriers afforded via e-mental health services, certain barriers to mental health care may persist, especially among Veterans who screen positive for PTSD.","Whealin, Julia M.",10.1682/JRRD.2014.04.0113,Journal of Rehabilitation Research & Development,e-mental health preferences of veterans with and without probable posttraumatic stress disorder.,2015

217,"OBJECTIVE: Supported housing programs have been successful in helping homeless adults obtain housing. This study examined whether improvements in social integration occur after clients obtain supported housing. METHODS: Measures of social integration were examined for 550 chronically homeless adults with mental illness who participated in the 11-site Collaborative Initiative to Help End Chronic Homelessness. Social integration was conceptualized as a multidimensional construct of variables in six domains: housing, work, social support, community participation, civic activity, and religious faith. Changes in baseline measures related to the six domains and their interrelationships were examined at six and 12 months after entry into the supported housing program. RESULTS: Chronically homeless adults showed substantial improvements in housing but remained socially isolated and showed limited improvement in other domains of social integration, which were only weakly correlated with one another. CONCLUSIONS: More attention is needed to develop rehabilitation interventions in supported housing programs to improve social integration of chronically homeless adults. Because improvements in some domains of social integration were only weakly related, it may be necessary to intervene in multiple domains simultaneously.

319,"Objective: This study compared the prevalence of depression and the determinants of mental health service use in Canada and the United States.Methods: The study used data from preliminary analyses of the 2003 Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health, which measured Canadian (N=3,505) and United States (N=5,183) resident ratings of health and health care services. Cross-national comparisons were made for the 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV major depression, 12-month service use for mental health reasons according to the type of professional seen, and determinants of service use.Results: The rates of depression were similar in Canada (8.2%) and the United States (8.7%). However, U.S. respondents without medical insurance were twice as likely as Canadian respondents and U.S. respondents with medical insurance to meet the criteria for depression. Rates of mental health service use did not differ between Canada (10.1%) and the United States (10.6%). In the United States, medical insurance was not a determinant factor of service use. However, U.S. respondents with no medical insurance were more likely than the other two groups to report an unmet need. Also, among those with depression, U.S. respondents with no medical insurance were less likely to use any type of mental health service (36.5%) than U.S. respondents with medical insurance (55.7%) and Canadians (55.7%). Further, a positive correlation between a mental health need and service use was observed in Canada but not for those without medical insurance in the United States.Conclusions: There was no difference in the prevalence of depression and mental health service use between Canada and the United States. Among those with depression, however, disparities in treatment seeking were found to be associated with medical insurance in the United States. Both Canada and the United States need to improve access to health services for those with mental disorders, and special attention is needed for those without medical insurance in the United States.",Vasiliadis H,NLM17215414,Psychiatric Services,do canada and the united states differ in prevalence of depression and utilization of services?,Jan2007

253,"Objective: The authors examined the disruption of ongoing treatments among individuals with preexisting mental disorders and the failure to initiate treatment among individuals with new-onset mental disorders in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.Methods: English-speaking adult Katrina survivors (N=1,043) responded to a telephone survey administered between January and March of 2006. The survey assessed posthurricane treatment of emotional problems and barriers to treatment among respondents with preexisting mental disorders as well as those with new-onset disorders posthurricane.Results: Among respondents with preexisting mental disorders who reported using mental health services in the year before the hurricane, 22.9% experienced reduction in or termination of treatment after Katrina. Among those respondents without preexisting mental disorders who developed new-onset disorders after the hurricane, 18.5% received some form of treatment for emotional problems. Reasons for failing to continue treatment among preexisting cases primarily involved structural barriers to treatment, while reasons for failing to seek treatment among new-onset cases primarily involved low perceived need for treatment. The majority (64.5%) of respondents receiving treatment post-Katrina were treated by general medical providers and received medication but no psychotherapy. Treatment of new-onset cases was positively related to age and income, while continued treatment of preexisting cases was positively related to race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic whites) and having health insurance.Conclusions: Many Hurricane Katrina survivors with mental disorders experienced unmet treatment needs, including frequent disruptions of existing care and widespread failure to initiate treatment for new-onset disorders. Future disaster management plans should anticipate both types of treatment needs.",Wang PS,NLM18086749,American Journal of Psychiatry,disruption of existing mental health treatments and failure to initiate new treatment after hurricane katrina.,Jan2008
282,"Objective: Prior research on racial and ethnic disparities in depression treatment has been limited by the scarcity of national samples that include an array of diagnostic and quality indicators and substantial numbers of non-English-speaking individuals from minority groups. Using nationally representative data for 8,762 persons, the authors evaluated differences in access to and quality of depression treatments between patients in racial-ethnic minority groups and non-Latino white patients.Methods: Access to mental health care was assessed by past-year receipt of any mental health treatment. Adequate treatment for acute depression was defined as four or more specialty or general health provider visits in the past year plus antidepressant use for 30 days or more or eight or more specialty mental health provider visits lasting at least 30 minutes, with no antidepressant use.Results: For persons with past-year depressive disorder, 63.7% of Latinos, 68.7% of Asians, and 58.8% of African Americans, compared with 40.2% of non-Latino whites, did not access any past-year mental health treatment (significantly different at p<.001). Disparities in the likelihood of both having access to and receiving adequate care for depression were significantly different for Asians and African Americans in contrast to non-Latino whites.Conclusions: Simply relying on present health care systems without consideration of the unique barriers to quality care that ethnic and racial minority populations face is unlikely to affect the pattern of disparities observed. Populations reluctant to visit a clinic for depression care may have correctly anticipated the limited quality of usual care.",Alegría M,10.1176/appi.ps.59.11.1264,Psychiatric Services,disparity in depression treatment among racial and ethnic minority populations in the united states.,Nov2008
249,"OBJECTIVE: There is evidence of disparities in depression treatment by factors such as age, race or ethnicity, and type of insurance. The purpose of this study was to assess whether observed disparities in treatment are due to differences in rates of treatment initiation or to differences in the quality of treatment once treatment has been initiated. METHODS: Logistic regression models using data from the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were estimated to assess the role of age, race or ethnicity, and type of insurance on rates of initiation of depression treatment for persons with self-reported depression and on rates of adequate treatment for those receiving treatment. RESULTS: African Americans and Latinos were significantly less likely to fill an antidepressant prescription than Caucasians. However, among patients who filled at least one prescription for an antidepressant, there were no racial or ethnic disparities in the probability of receiving an adequate trial of antidepressant medication. African Americans were more likely than Latinos and Caucasians to receive an adequate course of psychotherapy. Persons who did not have insurance coverage were less likely to initiate any depression treatment compared with those who did have insurance. However, if treatment was initiated, no difference in the probability of receiving adequate treatment was observed. Elderly persons were less likely to receive an adequate course of psychotherapy or counseling compared with younger persons. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in depression treatment appear to be due mainly to differences in rates of initiation of depression treatment, given that rates of adequate care generally did not differ once treatment was initiated.",Harman JS,NLM15572565,Psychiatric Services,disparities in the adequacy of depression treatment in the united states.,Dec2004
248,"Objective: Following efforts made in recent years to provide effective mental health treatments based on evidence-based guidelines, a working definition was developed in the literature detailing a minimum level of ""adequate mental health care"" for serious mental illness. However, little is known about racial or ethnic disparities in receipt of adequate mental health care for individuals affected with serious mental illness. The objective of this study was to examine disparities among Caucasian and Hispanic youths in receipt of adequate mental health care for past-year major depressive episodes.Methods: Data for this study were drawn from the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The study sample was composed of 1,169 Caucasian youths and 316 Hispanic youths aged 12 to 17 with past-year major depressive episodes. The percentages of youths in the sample who received adequate mental health care for past-year major depressive episodes were estimated, and the correlates of receipt of adequate mental health care were examined.Results: Thirty-four percent of the full sample received adequate mental health care for past-year major depressive episodes, but separate analyses indicated that adequate mental health care was received by a significantly higher proportion of Caucasian youths (36%) than Hispanic youths (27%). The odds of receiving adequate mental health care for past-year major depressive episodes for Caucasians were 1.55 times that of Hispanics (p=.01). Having Medicaid or coverage via the State Childrens Health Insurance Program significantly increased the odds of receiving adequate mental care for past-year major depressive episodes for both Hispanics and Caucasians.Conclusions: As mental health problems of adolescents from diverse racial or ethnic backgrounds become more easily identified and a larger proportion of these groups is referred to mental health treatment services, it is important to examine the degree to which treatment should be tailored to engage and retain specific racial or ethnic groups so that they will receive the minimum of adequate mental health care.",Alexandre PK,10.1176/ps.2009.60.10.1365,Psychiatric Services,disparities in adequate mental health care for past-year major depressive episodes among caucasian and hispanic youths.,Oct2009

102,"Objective: The study sought to identify the extent to which posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses are recorded in the electronic health record (EHR) in Army behavioral health clinics and to assess clinicians reasons for not recording them and treatment factors associated with recording or not recording the diagnosis.Methods: A total of 543 Army mental health providers completed the anonymous, Web-based survey. Clinicians reported clinical data for 399 service member patients, of whom 110 (28%) had a reported PTSD diagnosis. Data were weighted to account for sampling design and nonresponses.Results: Of those given a diagnosis of PTSD by their clinician, 59% were reported to have the diagnosis recorded in the EHR, and 41% did not. The most common reason for not recording was reducing stigma or protecting the service members career prospects. Psychiatrists were more likely than psychologists or social workers to record the diagnosis.Conclusions: Findings indicate that for many patients presenting with PTSD in Army behavioral health clinics at the time of the survey (2010), clinicians did not record a PTSD diagnosis in the EHR, often in an effort to reduce stigma. This pattern may exist for other diagnoses. Recent Army policy has provided guidance to clinicians on diagnostic recording practice. An important implication concerns the reliance on coded diagnoses in PTSD surveillance efforts by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The problem of underestimated prevalence rates may be further compounded by overly narrow DoD surveillance definitions of PTSD.","Wilk, Joshua E.",10.1176/appi.ps.201500292,Psychiatric Services,diagnosis of ptsd by army behavioral health clinicians: are diagnoses recorded in electronic health records?,Aug2016
338,"OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis-specific, proven efficacious treatments are a major recent advance in psychiatry. Appropriate use of such treatments presupposes patients who meet the diagnostic criteria and clinicians who have accurately diagnosed the target disorder and comorbid conditions. Since little is known about whether these prerequisites are commonly met, the authors conducted a study at two community treatment sites to determine the frequency of various axis I diagnoses and the concordance between the diagnoses recorded in patient charts and those obtained by a structured interview. Given that a DSM diagnosis may not be sufficient to understand a patients problems, the authors also obtained ratings of interpersonal functioning. METHOD: The subjects were 164 nonpsychotic patients who were seen at a rural (N=114) or urban (N=50) community treatment facility. Raters trained to reliably use the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) conducted diagnostic interviews. Clinical charts were reviewed to obtain clinical diagnoses. Patients completed questionnaires regarding interpersonal functioning. RESULTS: Most (N=145, 88%) of the patients met the SCID criteria for a current axis I diagnosis, and 53% (N=87) met the criteria for two or more disorders. Clinical and SCID diagnoses had poor agreement. Evidence was found for interpersonal dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients met the diagnostic criteria for conditions for which there are proven treatments; however, inaccurate diagnosis proved common. This barrier to optimal treatment could be ameliorated with the use of structured interviews for common diagnoses. Scores on social/interpersonal measures support the premise that DSM symptoms provide only part of the relevant information about patients conditions.",Shear MK,NLM10739417,American Journal of Psychiatry,diagnosis of nonpsychotic patients in community clinics.,Apr2000

354,"Background: Frail older people with mental health problems including delirium, dementia and depression are often admitted to general hospitals. However, hospital admission may cause distress, and can be associated with complications. Some commentators suggest that their healthcare needs could be better met elsewhere.Methods: We studied consecutive patients aged 70 or older admitted for emergency medical or trauma care to an 1800 bed general hospital which provided sole emergency medical and trauma services for its local population. Patients were screened for mental health problems, and those screening positive were invited to take part. 250 participants were recruited and a sub-sample of 53 patients was assessed by a geriatrician for diagnoses, impairments and disabilities, healthcare interventions and outstanding needs.Results: Median age was 86 years, median Mini-Mental State Examination score at admission was 16/30, and 45% had delirium. 19% lived in a care home prior to admission. All the patients were complex. A wide range of main admission diagnoses was recorded, and these were usually complicated by falls, immobility, pain, delirium, dehydration or incontinence. There was a median of six active diagnoses, and eight active problems. One quarter of problems was unexplained. A median of 13 interventions was recorded, and a median of a further four interventions suggested by the geriatrician. Those with more severe cognitive impairment had no less medical need.Conclusions: This patient group, admitted to hospital in the United Kingdom, had numerous healthcare problems, and by implication, extensive healthcare needs. Patients with simpler conditions were not identified, but may have already been rapidly discharged or redirected to non-hospital services by the time assessments were made. To meet the needs of this group outside the hospital would need considerable investment in medical, nursing, therapy and diagnostic facilities. In the meantime, acute hospitals should adapt to deliver comprehensive geriatric assessment, and provide for their mental health needs.","Glover, Alex",10.1186/1471-2318-14-43,BMC Geriatrics,"diagnoses, problems and healthcare interventions amongst older people with an unscheduled hospital admission who have concurrent mental health problems: a prevalence study.",2014

342,"Objective: This study examined diagnoses of patients treated by psychiatrists in private practice in Denmark and identified predictors of dropout.Methods: Between 1996 and 2006, a total of 37 psychiatrists contributed data about treatment episodes to a quality assurance database. The diagnostic distribution was determined, and univariate and backward stepwise regression analysis was used to identify dropout predictors.Results: Among 41,462 episodes (35,205 patients), 39%-41% were for an ICD-10 diagnosis of affective disorders, 30%-35% for nervous and stress-related disorders, and 10% for personality disorders. For episodes involving these diagnoses, 26,443 were terminated; 26.2% ended in dropout, which was predicted by the patients being male, younger age (< or =44 years), presence of personality disorder, shorter treatment duration (< or =111 days), use of psychotropic medication, and a larger population per psychiatrist in the catchment area.Conclusions: Attention should be given to younger male patients treated for personality disorders, because they are at higher risk of treatment dropout.",Munk-Jørgensen P,10.1176/ps.2009.60.12.1680,Psychiatric Services,diagnoses and dropout among patients of danish psychiatrists in private practice.,Dec2009

118,"Background: There is an emerging evidence base about best practice in supporting recovery. This is usually framed in relation to general principles, and specific pro-recovery interventions are lacking.Aims: To develop a theoretically based and empirically defensible new pro-recovery manualised intervention--called the REFOCUS intervention.Method: Seven systematic and two narrative reviews were undertaken. Identified evidence gaps were addressed in three qualitative studies. The findings were synthesised to produce the REFOCUS intervention, manual and model.Results: The REFOCUS intervention comprises two components: recovery-promoting relationships and working practices. Approaches to supporting relationships comprise coaching skills training for staff, developing a shared team understanding of recovery, exploring staff values, a Partnership Project with people who use the service and raising patient expectations. Working practices comprise the following: understanding values and treatment preferences; assessing strengths; and supporting goal-striving. The REFOCUS model describes the causal pathway from the REFOCUS intervention to improved recovery.Conclusions: The REFOCUS intervention is an empirically supported pro-recovery intervention for use in mental health services. It will be evaluated in a multisite cluster randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN02507940).","Slade, Mike",10.1192/bjp.bp.114.155978,British Journal of Psychiatry,development of the refocus intervention to increase mental health team support for personal recovery.,Dec2015

221,"OBJECTIVE: This article describes the creation, validation, and use of an assertive community treatment (ACT) Transition Readiness Scale (TRS) to identify clients who may be ready to transition from ACT services. Scale development was prompted by concerns over long stays on ACT teams and the resulting impact on access. METHODS: Data were extracted from a centralized clinical reporting system for all 1,365 persons enrolled for at least 12 months as of August 2008 in the 42 ACT teams in New York City, including 382 clients of eight of those ACT teams. Data in seven domains deemed relevant to transition readiness were used to calculate readiness scores for each client. An algorithm assigned clients to one of three categories: consider for transition, readiness unclear, and not ready. RESULTS: Via the TRS algorithm, of the 1,365 clients, 192 (14%) were assigned to the consider-for-transition group, 382 (28%) to the unclear group, and 791 (58%) to the not ready group. Clinicians on the eight ACT teams categorized 15% of their current clients in the consider-for-transition group, whereas the TRS algorithm classified 18% in this category. Overall, the TRS agreed with the category assigned by ACT team clinicians in 69% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The TRS may provide ACT teams and program administrators with a tool to identify clients who may be ready to transition to less intensive services, thereby opening scarce slots. Because ACT cases are complex, data summaries can offer useful syntheses of information, particularly when data from several assessments are used to summarize a clients trajectory.

Routine monitoring and evaluation data, including client flow and reports of satisfaction, were obtained from patients (n = 135) during the pilot-testing phase in two health facilities.Results: The resulting MHCP consists of 12 packages, divided over community, health facility and organisation platforms. Service implementation data support the real-life applicability of the MHCP, with reasonable treatment uptake. Key barriers were identified and addressed, namely dissatisfaction with privacy, perceived burden among health workers and high drop-out rates.Conclusions: The MHCP follows a collaborative care model encompassing community and primary healthcare interventions.","Jordans, M.

Methods: A literature review on collaborative mental health care for depression was completed and used to guide discussion at an interactive workshop with pan-Canadian participants comprising people treated for depression with collaborative mental health care, as well as their family members; primary care and mental health practitioners; decision makers; and researchers. Thematic analysis of qualitative data from the workshop identified key attributes of collaborative care that are important to consumers and family members, as well as factors that may contribute to improved consumer experiences. Results: The workshop identified an overarching theme of partnership between consumers and practitioners involved in collaborative care. Eight attributes of collaborative care were considered to be essential or very important to consumers and family members: respectfulness; involvement of consumers in treatment decisions; accessibility; provision of information; coordination; whole-person care; responsiveness to changing needs; and comprehensiveness. Three inter-related groups of factors may affect the consumer experience of collaborative care, namely, organizational aspects of care; consumer characteristics and personal resources; and community resources. Conclusion: A preliminary evaluation framework was developed and is presented here to guide further evaluation and research on consumer-centred collaborative mental health care for depression.","McCusker, Jane",NLM23461887,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,developing an evaluation framework for consumer-centred collaborative care of depression using input from stakeholders.,Mar2013

218,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined the predictors of actions to initiate involuntary commitment of individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. METHODS: Emergency services clinicians throughout Virginia completed a questionnaire following each face-to-face evaluation of individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. Over a one-month period in 2007, a total of 2,624 adults were evaluated. Logistic hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyze the relationship between demographic, clinical, and service-related variables and outcomes of the emergency evaluations. RESULTS: Several factors predicted 84% of the actions taken to initiate involuntary commitment. These included unavailability of alternatives to hospitalization, such as temporary housing or residential crisis stabilization; evaluation of the client in a hospital emergency room or police station or while in police custody; current enrollment in treatment; and clinical factors related to the commitment criteria, including risk of self-harm or harm to others, acuity and severity of the crisis, and current drug abuse or dependence. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of intensive community-based treatment and support in lieu of hospitalization accounted for a significant portion of variance in actions to initiate involuntary commitment. Comprehensive community services and supports for individuals experiencing mental health crises may reduce the rate of involuntary hospitalization. There is a need to enrich intensive community mental health services and supports and to evaluate the impact of these enhancements on the frequency of involuntary mental health interventions.","McGarvey, Elizabeth Lloyd",10.1176/appi.ps.000692012,Psychiatric Services,decisions to initiate involuntary commitment: the role of intensive community services and other factors.,Feb2013

Computerized Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are suggested to be able to improve diagnostic procedures, but some studies indicate possible problems. Therefore, it could be important to investigate CDSS systems with regard to their feasibility to improve diagnostic procedures as well as to save time.~Background~Background~This study was undertaken to compare the traditional paper and pencil diagnostic method SCID1 with the computer-aided diagnostic system CB-SCID1 to ascertain processing time and accuracy of diagnoses suggested. 63 clinicians volunteered to participate in the study and to solve two paper-based cases using either a CDSS or manually.~Methods~Methods~No major difference between paper and pencil and computer-supported diagnosis was found. Where a difference was found it was in favour of paper and pencil. For example, a significantly shorter time was found for paper and pencil for the difficult case, as compared to computer support. A significantly higher number of correct diagnoses were found in the diffilt case for the diagnosis Depression using the paper and pencil method. Although a majority of the clinicians found the computer method supportive and easy to use, it took a longer time and yielded fewer correct diagnoses than with paper and pencil.~Results~Results~This study could not detect any major difference in diagnostic outcome between traditional paper and pencil methods and computer support for psychiatric diagnosis. Where there were significant differences, traditional paper and pencil methods were better than the tested CDSS and thus we conclude that CDSS for diagnostic procedures may interfere with diagnosis accuracy. A limitation was that most clinicians had not previously used the CDSS system under study. The results of this study, however, confirm that CDSS development for diagnostic purposes in psychiatry has much to deal with before it can be used for routine clinical purposes.~Conclusion~Conclusions",Bergman LG,NLM18261222,BMC Medical Informatics & Decision Making,decision support in psychiatry - a comparison between the diagnostic outcomes using a computerized decision support system versus manual diagnosis.,2008

332,"Background: Burgeoning global mental health endeavors have renewed debates about cultural applicability of psychiatric categories. This studys goal is to review strengths and limitations of literature comparing psychiatric categories with cultural concepts of distress (CCD) such as cultural syndromes, culture-bound syndromes, and idioms of distress.Methods: The Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observational Research (SAQOR) was adapted based on cultural psychiatry principles to develop a Cultural Psychiatry Epidemiology version (SAQOR-CPE), which was used to rate quality of quantitative studies comparing CCD and psychiatric categories. A meta-analysis was performed for each psychiatric category.Results: Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria, with 18 782 unique participants. Primary objectives of the studies included comparing CCD and psychiatric disorders (51%), assessing risk factors for CCD (18%) and instrument validation (16%). Only 27% of studies met SAQOR-CPE criteria for medium quality, with the remainder low or very low quality. Only 29% of studies employed representative samples, 53% used validated outcome measures, 44% included function assessments and 44% controlled for confounding. Meta-analyses for anxiety, depression, PTSD and somatization revealed high heterogeneity (I(2) > 75%). Only general psychological distress had low heterogeneity (I(2) = 8%) with a summary effect odds ratio of 5.39 (95% CI 4.71-6.17). Associations between CCD and psychiatric disorders were influenced by methodological issues, such as validation designs (? = 16.27, 95%CI 12.75-19.79) and use of CCD multi-item checklists (? = 6.10, 95%CI 1.89-10.31). Higher quality studies demonstrated weaker associations of CCD and psychiatric disorders.Conclusions: Cultural concepts of distress are not inherently unamenable to epidemiological study. However, poor study quality impedes conceptual advancement and service application. With improved study design and reporting using guidelines such as the SAQOR-CPE, CCD research can enhance detection of mental health problems, reduce cultural biases in diagnostic criteria and increase cultural salience of intervention trial outcomes.","Kohrt, Brandon A",10.1093/ije/dyt227,International Journal of Epidemiology,cultural concepts of distress and psychiatric disorders: literature review and research recommendations for global mental health epidemiology.,Apr2014

359,"Background: The use of compulsory treatment under the Mental Health Act (MHA) has continued to rise in the UK and in other countries. The Joint Crisis Plan (JCP) is a statement of service users wishes for treatment in the event of a future mental health crisis. It is developed with the clinical team and an independent facilitator. A recent pilot RCT showed a reduction in the use of the MHA amongst service users with a JCP. The JCP is the only intervention that has been shown to reduce compulsory treatment in this way. The CRIMSON trial aims to determine if JCPs, compared with treatment as usual, are effective in reducing the use of the MHA in a range of treatment settings across the UK.Methods/design: This is a 3 centre, individual-level, single-blind, randomised controlled trial of the JCP compared with treatment as usual for people with a history of relapsing psychotic illness in Birmingham, London and Lancashire/Manchester. 540 service users will be recruited across the three sites. Eligible service users will be adults with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (including bipolar disorder), treated in the community under the Care Programme Approach with at least one admission to a psychiatric inpatient ward in the previous two years. Current inpatients and those subject to a community treatment order will be excluded to avoid any potential perceived pressure to participate. Research assessments will be conducted at baseline and 18 months. Following the baseline assessment, eligible service users will be randomly allocated to either develop a Joint Crisis Plan or continue with treatment as usual. Outcome will be assessed at 18 months with assessors blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is the proportion of service users treated or otherwise detained under an order of the Mental Health Act (MHA) during the follow-up period, compared across randomisation groups. Secondary outcomes include overall costs, service user engagement, perceived coercion and therapeutic relationships. Sub-analyses will explore the effectiveness of the JCP in reducing use of the MHA specifically for Black Caribbean and Black African service users (combined). Qualitative investigations with staff and service users will explore the acceptability of the JCPs.Discussion: JCPs offer a potential solution to the rise of compulsory treatment for individuals with psychotic disorders and, if shown to be effective in this trial, they are likely to be of interest to mental health service providers worldwide.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN11501328.","Thornicroft, Graham",10.1186/1745-6215-11-102,Trials,crimson crisis plan impact: subjective and objective coercion and engagement protocol: a randomised controlled trial of joint crisis plans to reduce compulsory treatment of people with psychosis.,2010

Participants were randomly assigned at each site to enhanced treatment as usual (N=97), including education about blood-borne diseases and referrals for testing and vaccinations, or to an experimental intervention (N=105) that provided on-site infectious disease education, screening of risk level, pretest counseling, testing for HIV and hepatitis B and C, vaccination for hepatitis A and B, and personalized risk-reduction counseling. The authors compared the two study groups to assess the average costs of improving hepatitis and HIV testing and hepatitis A and B vaccination in this population.Results: The average cost per participant was $423 for the intervention and $24 for the comparison condition (t=52.7, df=201, p<.001). The costs per additional person tested was $706 for hepatitis C, $776 for hepatitis B, and $3,630 for HIV, and the cost per additional person vaccinated for hepatitis was $561.Conclusions: Delivery of hepatitis and HIV public health services to persons with serious mental illness in outpatient mental health settings can be as cost-effective as similar interventions for other at-risk populations.","Slade, Eric P",10.1176/appi.ps.000852011,Psychiatric Services,costs of a public health model to increase receipt of hepatitis-related services for persons with mental illness.,Feb2013
284,"OBJECTIVES: Cost-effective programs are needed to assist homeless persons with severe mental illness in their transition from shelters to community living. The authors investigated the cost-effectiveness of the critical time intervention program, a time-limited adaptation of intensive case management, which has been shown to significantly reduce recurrent homelessness among men with severe mental illness. METHOD:S: Ninety-six study participants recruited from a psychiatric program in a mens public shelter from 1991 to 1993 were randomly assigned to the critical time intervention program or to usual services. Costs and housing outcomes for the two groups were examined over 18 months. RESULTS: Over the study period, the critical time intervention group and the usual services group incurred mean costs of 52,374 dollars and 51,649 dollars, respectively, for acute care services, outpatient services, housing and shelter services, criminal justice services, and transfer income. During the same period, the critical time intervention group experienced significantly fewer homeless nights than the usual care group (32 nights versus 90 nights). For each willingness-to-pay value--the additional price society is willing to spend for an additional nonhomeless night--greater than 152 dollars, the critical time intervention group exhibited a significantly greater net housing stability benefit, indicating cost-effectiveness, compared with usual care. CONCLUSION:S: Although difficult to conduct, studies of the cost-effectiveness of community mental health programs can yield rich information for policy makers and program planners. The critical time intervention program is not only an effective method to reduce recurrent homelessness among persons with severe mental illness but also represents a cost-effective alternative to the status quo.",Jones K,NLM12773605,Psychiatric Services,cost-effectiveness of critical time intervention to reduce homelessness among persons with mental illness.,Jun2003

METHODS: Claims records for adult participants in Medicaid fee-for-service systems in Philadelphia during 1996 (N=60,503) were used to identify diagnostic groups and to construct estimates of reimbursement costs by type of service for the year. The estimates included all outpatient and inpatient treatment costs per year per person and excluded pharmacy costs and the cost of nursing home care. Persons with severe mental illness, HIV infection, or AIDS had received those diagnoses between 1985 and 1996. RESULTS: Persons with comorbid serious mental illness and HIV infection or AIDS had the highest annual medical and behavioral health treatment expenditures (about $13,800 per person), followed by persons with HIV infection or AIDS only (annual expenditures of about $7,400 per person). Annual expenditures for persons with serious mental illness only were about $5,800 per person. The control group without serious mental illness, HIV infection, or AIDS had annual expenditures of about $1,800 per person. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high cost of treating persons with comorbid serious mental illness and HIV infection or AIDS, the integration of HIV prevention into ongoing case management for persons with serious mental illness who are at risk of infection may prove to be a cost-effective intervention strategy.",Rothbard AB,NLM12954940,Psychiatric Services,cost of care for medicaid recipients with serious mental illness and hiv infection or aids.,Sep2003

It also identified predictors of receiving minimally adequate specialty treatment, defined as attending at least nine clinic visits within 365 days of screening positive for PTSD.Methods: VA administrative data were obtained for 869 veterans who screened positive for PTSD between November 7, 2006, and September 30, 2008, received a diagnosis of PTSD, and visited a PTSD specialty clinic operated by the VA in the Pacific Northwest at least once within a year of screening positive.Results: A total of 286 (33%) of the 852 veterans for whom complete data were available received minimally adequate specialty treatment; OEF-OIF veterans were less likely than non-OEF-OIF veterans to receive minimally adequate specialty treatment (29% versus 36%, p=.021) and attended fewer mean±SD visits to a PTSD clinic (8.2±11.4 versus 9.9±13.5, p=.045). Predictors of receiving minimally adequate specialty treatment included attending a PTSD clinic visit within 30 days of a positive screen, living in an urban location, and having psychiatric comorbidities.Conclusions: Most veterans with new PTSD diagnoses who initiated VA PTSD specialty care did not receive minimally adequate specialty treatment.

160,"Objective: To address the gaps between need and access, and between treatment guidelines and their implementation for mental illness, through capacity building of front-line health workers.Methods: Following a learning needs assessment, work-based continuing education courses in evidence-supported psychotherapies were developed for front-line workers in underserviced community settings. The 5-hour courses on the fundamentals of cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, motivational interviewing, and dialectical behaviour therapy each included videotaped captioned simulations, interactive lesson plans, and clinical practice behaviour reminders. Two courses, sequentially offered in 7 underserviced settings, were subjected to a mixed methods evaluation. Ninety-three nonmedical front-line workers enrolled in the program. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess pre- and postintervention changes in knowledge and self-efficacy. Qualitative data from 5 semistructured focus groups with 25 participants were also analyzed.Results: Significant pre- and postintervention changes in knowledge (P < 0.001) were found in course completers. Counselling self-efficacy improved in participants who took the first course offered (P = 0.001). Dropouts were much less frequent in peer-led, small-group learning than in a self-directed format. Qualitative analysis revealed improved confidence, morale, self-reported practice behaviour changes, and increased comfort in working with difficult clients.Conclusion: This work-based, multimodal, interactive, interprofessional curriculum for knowledge translation of psychotherapeutic techniques is feasible and helpful. A peer-led group format is preferred over self-directed learning. Its application can build capacity of front-line health workers in helping patients who suffer from common mental disorders.","Ravitz, Paula",NLM23768261,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,continuing education to go: capacity building in psychotherapies for front-line mental health workers in underserviced communities.,Jun2013

A structured interview was used to facilitate the expression of rehabilitation goals by consumers in the psychiatric rehabilitation program of a hospital in Montreal, Canada. The most frequently mentioned rehabilitation goals pertained to improving consumers financial situation, physical health, cognitive capacities, and symptoms. Among these goals, the level of concordance was highest for services addressing symptoms and lowest for religious or spiritual goals.",Lecomte T,NLM15703351,Psychiatric Services,consumers goals in psychiatric rehabilitation and their concordance with existing services.,Feb2005
182,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether employing mental health consumers as consumer-providers in assertive community treatment teams can enhance outcomes for clients with severe mental illness. METHODS: In a prospective longitudinal study, presence of consumer-providers and outcomes of 530 clients with severe mental illness in 20 outpatient teams were assessed at baseline and at one-year and two-year follow-ups. Measures included the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS), the Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Assessment Schedule (CANSAS), the Working Alliance Scale, the number of hospital days, and the number of days of homelessness. Multilevel regression was used with the independent variables consumer-provider presence, time of measurement, and their interaction. RESULTS: A positive association was found between consumer-provider presence and improvements in functioning on the HoNOS (p=.020), met needs in relation to personal recovery (p=.044), unmet needs in relation to personal recovery (p=.008), and number of homeless days (p.001). A negative association was found for consumer-provider presence and the number of hospital days (p=.019). CONCLUSIONS: Consumer-providers are important participants in outpatient teams serving clients with severe mental illnesses, although integrating these providers as part of a team is a slow process.

159,"Objectives: The authors compared attitudes of the U.S. general public and of mental health professionals about the competence and perceived dangerousness of people with mental health problems and the desire for social distance from them. Factors related to negative attitudes and the desire for social distance also were examined.Methods: Vignettes describing individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression and schizophrenia were included in the 2006 General Social Survey (GSS) and a 2009 study of mental health professionals, and responses were descriptively compared (GSS, N=397 responses to depression vignette, N=373 responses to schizophrenia vignette; 731 mental health professionals responded to both vignettes). Regression analyses examined whether demographic and provider characteristics were associated with perceptions of less competence and perceived dangerousness of the vignette character and with respondents desire for social distance.Results: Compared with the American public, mental health professionals had significantly more positive attitudes toward people with mental health problems. However, some providers conceptions about the dangerousness of people with schizophrenia and provider desire for social distance from clients in work and personal situations were concerning. Younger age, self-identifying as non-Hispanic white, being female, having at least a four-year college degree, being familiar with mental illness, and certain job titles and more years of experience in the mental health field were predictive of more positive conceptions.Conclusions: Although mental health professionals held more positive attitudes than the general public about people with mental health problems, strong stereotypes persisted in both groups, especially concerning schizophrenia. This study identified several demographic and provider characteristics that can inform intervention strategies in both groups.","Stuber, Jennifer P",10.1176/appi.ps.201300136,Psychiatric Services,conceptions of mental illness: attitudes of mental health professionals and the general public.,Apr2014

242,"Objective: The aim of this study was to identify components of cultural competence in mental health programs developed for cultural groups by community and mental health professionals from these groups.Methods: Three programs were studied: a prevention program primarily serving African-American and Afro-Caribbean youth, a Latino adult acute inpatient unit, and a Chinese day treatment program in a community-based agency. Nine study-trained field researchers used a semistructured instrument that captures program genealogy, structure, processes, and cultural infusion. Program cultural elements were identified from field notes and from individual and group interviews of consumers and staff (N=104). A research-group consensus process with feedback from program staff was used to group elements by shared characteristics into the program components of cultural competence.Results: Components included communication competencies (with use of colloquialisms and accepted forms of address); staff in culturally acceptable roles; culturally framed trust building (such as pairing youths with mentors), stigma reduction, friendly milieus (such as serving culturally familiar foods and playing music popular with the culture), and services; and peer, family, and community involvement (including use of peer counselors and mentors, hosting parent weekends, and linking clients with senior center and community services).Conclusions: Incorporating these components into any program in which underserved cultural populations are seen is recommended for improving cultural competence.",Siegel C,10.1176/ps.62.6.pss6206_0626,Psychiatric Services,components of cultural competence in three mental health programs.,Jun2011

They also discuss methodological issues relevant to the development and testing of cognitive training approaches, with the goal of creating maximally efficient and effective approaches to training. Finally, they identify gaps in existing knowledge and outline key research directions for the future.Results: While much of the early research has been conducted in schizophrenia, cognitive training has more recently been applied to a widening range of neuropsychiatric illnesses, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mood disorders, and substance use disorders. Cognitive training harnesses the inherent neuroplastic capacities of the brain, targeting neural system function across psychiatric disorders, thus improving the cognitive processes that play a role in emotion regulation, clinical symptoms, and adaptive community functioning.Conclusions: Cognitive training offers considerable promise, especially given the limited efficacy of pharmacological interventions in ameliorating cognitive deficits. However, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying cognitive training, predictors of response, generalization and real-world applicability, and approaches to dissemination in practice settings.","Keshavan, Matcheri S",10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13081075,American Journal of Psychiatry,cognitive training in mental disorders: update and future directions.,May2014

Design and Setting: Randomized, parallel-group, clinical trial conducted at a single Veterans Affairs medical center, with recruitment from March 2001 to June 2005. Participants: Eighty-one adults (n = 11 women; mean age, 54.2 years) with chronic primary (n = 40) or comorbid insomnia associated predominantly with mixed psychiatric disorders (n = 41). Interventions: Patients, screened via structured interviews and diagnostic polysomnography, were randomly assigned to receive CBT (sleep education, stimulus control, and time-in-bed restrictions; 20 patients with primary and 21 with comorbid insomnia), or sleep hygiene (SH: education about aspects of lifestyle and the bedroom environment that affect sleep; 20 patients with primary and 20 with comorbid insomnia). Outpatient treatment included 4 biweekly sessions with a posttreatment assessment and a follow-up conducted at 6 months. Measures and Results: Participants completed actigraphy and sleep diaries for 2 weeks prior to therapy, during a 2-week posttreatment assessment, and during 2 weeks at follow-up. They also completed questionnaires measuring global insomnia symptoms, general sleep quality, and sleep-disruptive beliefs before treatment, immediately following treatment, and at the follow-up time point. Consistent with previous studies, CBT outperformed sleep hygiene across several study outcome measures for the sample as a whole. Statistical analyses showed no significant 3-way interaction of treatment group, time, and insomnia type for any of the sleep or questionnaire measures, suggesting the benefits of CBT over sleep hygiene were comparable for patients with primary insomnia and comorbid insomnia. Moreover, only 1 of several indexes of clinically notable improvement suggested a significantly better response to CBT by patients with primary insomnia, as compared with those with comorbid insomnia. Conclusions: A fixed 4-session dose of CBT produced similar benefits for patients with primary and those with comorbid insomnia across most measures examined. Thus, CBT appears to be a viable psychological insomnia therapy both for those with primary insomnia and for groups composed mainly of patients with insomnia and nonpsychotic psychiatric conditions.",Edinger JD,NLM19413144,Sleep,cognitive behavioral therapy for patients with primary insomnia or insomnia associated predominantly with mixed psychiatric disorders: a randomized clinical trial.,2009 Apr 1

204,"Objective: African Americans underutilize traditional mental health services, compared with white Americans. The authors conducted a systematic review of studies involving church-based health promotion programs for mental disorders among African Americans to assess the feasibility of utilizing such programs to address racial disparities in mental health care.Methods: A literature review of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ATLA Religion databases was conducted to identify articles published between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2009. Inclusion criteria were as follows: studies were conducted in a church; the primary objective involved assessment, perceptions and attitudes, education, prevention, group support, or treatment for DSM-IV mental disorders or their correlates; number of participants was reported; qualitative or quantitative data were reported; and African Americans were the target population.Results: Of 1,451 studies identified, only eight met inclusion criteria. Five studies focused on substance-related disorders, six were designed to assess the effects of a specific intervention, and six targeted adults. One study focused on depression and was limited by a small sample size of seven participants.Conclusions: Although church-based health promotion programs have been successful in addressing racial disparities for several chronic medical conditions, the literature on such programs for mental disorders is extremely limited. More intensive research is needed to establish the feasibility and acceptability of utilizing church-based health promotion programs as a possible resource for screening and treatment to improve disparities in mental health care for African Americans.",Hankerson SH,10.1176/appi.ps.201100216,Psychiatric Services,church-based health programs for mental disorders among african americans: a review.,Mar2012

130,"Objective: The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) is a disability scale included in Section 3 of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a possible replacement for the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF). To assist Canadian psychiatrists with interpretation of the scale, we have conducted a descriptive analysis using data from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health component (CCHS-MH).Methods: The 2012 CCHS-MH was a cross-sectional survey of the Canadian community (n = 23,757). The survey included an abbreviated 12-item version of the WHODAS 2.0. Mental disorder diagnoses were assessed for schizophrenia, other psychosis, major depressive episode (MDE), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), bipolar I disorder, substance abuse/dependence, and alcohol abuse/dependence.Results: Mean scores ranged from 14.2 (95% CI, 14.1 to 14.3) for the overall community population to 23.1 (95% CI, 19.5 to 26.7) for those with schizophrenia, with higher scores indicating greater disability. Furthermore, the difference in scores between those with lifetime and past-month episodes suggests that the scale is sensitive to changes occurring during the course of these disorders; for example, scores varied from 23.6 (95% CI, 22.2 to 25.1) for past-month MDE to 14.4 (95% CI, 14.2 to 14.7) in the lifetime MDE group without a past-year episode.Conclusion: This analysis suggests that the WHODAS 2.0 may be a suitable replacement for the GAF. As a disability measure, even though it is not a mental health-specific instrument, the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 appears to be sensitive to the impact of mental disorders and to changes over the time course of a mental disorder. However, the clinical utility of this measure requires additional assessment.","Sjonnesen, Kirsten",10.1177/0706743716632514,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,characterization of disability in canadians with mental disorders using an abbreviated version of a dsm-5 emerging measure: the 12-item who disability assessment schedule (whodas) 2.0.,Apr2016

131,"OBJECTIVE Large-scale health care systems such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have recently invested heavily in the expansion of psychotherapy services. This study examined longitudinal changes in use of psychotherapy at the VHA during a period of substantial programmatic change targeting increased availability and quality of mental health care. METHODS This retrospective cohort study used data from the VHA National Patient Care Database outpatient treatment files to identify patients with a new-onset diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder during fiscal years (FYs) 2004 (N=424,428), 2007 (N=494,318), and 2010 (N=583,733). Use of psychotherapy during the 12 months after diagnosis was assessed. RESULTS The proportion of patients receiving any psychotherapy increased across the three study time points (FY 2004, 21%; FY 2007, 22%; and FY 2010, 27%). Amount of psychotherapy also increased such that with time a growing proportion of patients received eight or more psychotherapy sessions. The median time between diagnosis and start of psychotherapy decreased from 56 to 47 days from FY 2004 to FY 2010. Consistent with VHA expansion efforts, more substantial increases in psychotherapy reach, amount, and timeliness occurred between FY 2007 and 2010 than between FY 2004 and FY 2007. CONCLUSIONS These findings highlight recent increases in the use of VHA psychotherapy and correspond to substantial efforts to improve access to mental health services. Despite these advances, most newly diagnosed patients received no psychotherapy or a low-intensity amount of psychotherapy. Additional efforts to promote veteran engagement in needed mental health services appear warranted.","Mott, Juliette M",10.1176/appi.ps.201300056,Psychiatric Services,"changes in psychotherapy utilization among veterans with depression, anxiety, and ptsd.",Jan2014

320,"Objective: The objective of this study was to assess changes in individual beneficiaries utilization and expenditures that occur when individuals with depression, who often require maintenance treatment, return to Medicaid after a period of interrupted Medicaid coverage.Methods: Data from 1999 to 2002 Florida Medicaid claims from and eligibility files for beneficiaries with depression whose coverage was interrupted (N=1,946) were used to assess individual changes in the number of inpatient episodes, length of inpatient stay, emergency department visits, and total Medicaid expenditures between the three-month period immediately before and the three-month period immediately after an interruption in coverage. Multivariate analyses were used to assess how beneficiary characteristics are associated with changes in utilization and expenditures.Results: The number of inpatient episodes increased by .054 episode (p<.001), the length of inpatient stay increased by .32 day (p<.001), the number of emergency department visits increased by .57 visit (p<.001), and total Medicaid expenditures increased by 430 dollars (p<.001) in the three-month period after an interruption in coverage of more than one month. Individuals with depression who qualified for Medicaid because of a disability had a greater likelihood of experiencing higher expenditures after an interruption than individuals who were not disabled.Conclusions: Utilization of emergency and inpatient services and Medicaid expenditures significantly increased for beneficiaries with depression when they returned to Medicaid after experiencing a temporary loss in coverage, especially for beneficiaries with a documented disability.

244,"Objective: This study examined changes in possession of guideline-recommended medication among three groups of New York State Medicaid enrollees with severe mental illness: those who received an involuntary outpatient commitment order, voluntary enhanced services, or neither of these interventions.Methods: An observational study was conducted with New York State Medicaid claims data for enrollees with bipolar, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorders in New York City, Long Island, and the Hudson River regions from 2000 to 2005 (N=7,762). With adjustment for clinical and demographic characteristics, logistic regression models predicted the probability of a monthly medication possession ratio (MPR) ? 80% for medications recommended by expert guidelines or by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the indicated psychiatric diagnosis. Separate models were fit by region and for patients who ever received assisted outpatient treatment (AOT), voluntary enhanced services but never AOT, or neither treatment.Results: In all three regions, for all three groups, the predicted probability of an MPR ? 80% improved over time (AOT improved by 31-40 percentage points, followed by enhanced services, which improved by 15-22 points, and ""neither treatment,"" improving 8-19 points). Some regional differences in MPR trajectories were observed.Conclusions: After New York implemented AOT and increased community resources for enhanced services, guideline-recommended medication possession improved among Medicaid enrollees with severe mental illness--even among those who never received these interventions or services. However, further study is needed to understand why there were different regional trajectories and why some groups did not gain similarly across regions.","Busch, Alisa B",10.1176/ps.2010.61.10.1000,Psychiatric Services,changes in guideline-recommended medication possession after implementing kendras law in new york.,Oct2010

METHODS: In 2009, we analyzed data from the 1995 and 2005 Midlife in the United States cross-sectional surveys (n = 1723), which measured positive mental health and 12-month mental disorders of major depressive episode, panic, and generalized anxiety disorders. RESULTS: Population prevalence of any of 3 mental disorders and levels of mental health appeared stable but were dynamic at the individual level. Fifty-two percent of the 17.5% of respondents with any mental illness in 2005 were new cases; one half of those languishing in 1995 improved in 2005, and one half of those flourishing in 1995 declined in 2005. Change in mental health was strongly predictive of prevalence and incidence (operationalized as a new, not necessarily a first, episode) of mental illness in 2005. CONCLUSIONS: Gains in mental health predicted declines in mental illness, supporting the call for public mental health promotion; losses of mental health predicted increases in mental illness, supporting the call for public mental health protection.",Keyes CLM,10.2105/AJPH.2010.192245,American Journal of Public Health,change in level of positive mental health as a predictor of future risk of mental illness.,Dec2010
189,"OBJECTIVE Public stigma and discrimination have pernicious effects on the lives of people with serious mental illnesses. Given a plethora of research on changing the stigma of mental illness, this article reports on a meta-analysis that examined the effects of antistigma approaches that included protest or social activism, education of the public, and contact with persons with mental illness. METHODS The investigators heeded published guidelines for systematic literature reviews in health care. This comprehensive and systematic review included articles in languages other than English, dissertations, and population studies. The search included all articles from the inception of the databases until October 2010. Search terms fell into three categories: stigma, mental illness (such as schizophrenia and depression), and change program (including contact and education). The search yielded 72 articles and reports meeting the inclusion criteria of relevance to changing public stigma and sufficient data and statistics to complete analyses. Studies represented 38,364 research participants from 14 countries. Effect sizes were computed for all studies and for each treatment condition within studies. Comparisons between effect sizes were conducted with a weighted one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS Overall, both education and contact had positive effects on reducing stigma for adults and adolescents with a mental illness. However, contact was better than education at reducing stigma for adults. For adolescents, the opposite pattern was found: education was more effective. Overall, face-to-face contact was more effective than contact by video. CONCLUSIONS Future research is needed to identify moderators of the effects of both education and contact.",Corrigan PW,10.1176/appi.ps.201100529,Psychiatric Services,challenging the public stigma of mental illness: a meta-analysis of outcome studies.,Oct2012

302,"Objective: Case management studies from Europe and the United States continue to yield conflicting results. At a symposium at the World Psychiatric Conference in Hamburg in 1999, researchers from four European countries explored the possible reasons for differences in outcome. They also examined reasons for the differing foci of case management studies across the different cultures. The authors summarize the symposiums findings. Methods: Individual case presentations were given of studies and services from the United Kingdom (three studies), Sweden (two studies), Germany, and Italy (one each). Outcomes, methodologies, and national service context were examined. Results and Conclusions: A significant influence of national culture is evident both in the acceptability of case management and in approaches to researching it. Case management is perceived as an ""Anglophone import"" in Italy but is now national policy for persons with severe mental illness in the other three countries. Studies from the United Kingdom emphasized methodological rigor, with little attention to treatment content, whereas those from Sweden accepted a less disruptive research approach but with a more prescriptive stipulation of treatment content. Studies from Italy and Germany emphasized the importance of differing descriptive methodologies. Marked differences in the range of social care provision were noted across Europe.

122,"Background: The assessment of general health and well-being in public mental health research stimulates debates around relative merits of questionnaire instruments and their items. Little evidence regarding alignment or differential advantages of instruments or items has appeared to date.Aims: Population-based psychometric study of items employed in public mental health narratives.Method: Multidimensional item response theory was applied to General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) and EQ-5D items (Health Survey for England, 2010-2012; n = 19 290).Results: A bifactor model provided the best account of the data and showed that the GHQ-12 and WEMWBS items assess mainly the same construct. Only one item of the EQ-5D showed relevant overlap with this dimension (anxiety/depression). Findings were corroborated by comparisons with alternative models and cross-validation analyses.Conclusions: The consequences of this lack of differentiation (GHQ-12 v. WEMWBS) for mental health and well-being narratives deserves discussion to enrich debates on priorities in public mental health and its assessment.","Böhnke, Jan R.",10.1192/bjp.bp.115.165530,British Journal of Psychiatry,"calibrating well-being, quality of life and common mental disorder items: psychometric epidemiology in public mental health research.",Aug2016

322,"Objective: In order to expand the research base on effective community-based mental health treatments, methods are needed to define and evaluate promising interventions that have not been systematically developed and tested. In this report, the authors describe the results of an effort to better define the wraparound process for children and adolescents with serious emotional and behavioral problems.Methods: A broad review of wraparound treatment manuals and model descriptions was conducted. With the help of a small group of experts, this review was synthesized into an initial description of the phases and activities of the wraparound process. This model was then presented to a multidisciplinary advisory panel of 31 experts on the wraparound process who provided structured and semistructured feedback.Results: Overall, respondents expressed a high level of agreement with the proposed set of activities. For 23 of the 31 activities presented, there was unanimous or near-unanimous agreement (that is, one dissenter) that the activity was an essential component of the wraparound process. For 20 of the 31 activities, there was unanimous agreement that the description was phrased acceptably. A final model was created on the basis of feedback from reviewers.Conclusions: Results indicate that using the experience of a wide base of stakeholders to operationalize a complex model such as wraparound is feasible and holds many potential benefits, including building consensus in the field, improving service quality, and accelerating the incorporation of evaluation results into real-world practice.",Walker JS,NLM17085605,Psychiatric Services,building on practice-based evidence: using expert perspectives to define the wraparound process.,Nov2006

193,"Objective: Depressed mothers of children with psychiatric illness struggle with both their own psychiatric disorder and the demands of caring for ill children. When maternal depression remains untreated, mothers suffer, and psychiatric illness in their offspring is less likely to improve. This randomized, controlled trial compared the interpersonal psychotherapy for depressed mothers (IPT-MOMS), a nine-session intervention based on standard interpersonal psychotherapy, to treatment as usual for depressed mothers with psychiatrically ill offspring.Method: Forty-seven mothers meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression were recruited from a pediatric mental health clinic where their school-age children were receiving psychiatric treatment and randomly assigned to IPT-MOMS (N=26) or treatment as usual (N=21). Mother-child pairs were assessed at three time points: baseline, 3-month follow-up, and 9-month follow-up. Child treatment was not determined by the study.Results: Compared to subjects assigned to treatment as usual, subjects assigned to IPT-MOMS showed significantly lower levels of depression symptoms, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and higher levels of functioning, as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning, at 3-month and 9-month follow-ups. Compared to the offspring of mothers receiving treatment as usual, the offspring of mothers assigned to IPT-MOMS showed significantly lower levels of depression as measured by the Childrens Depressive Inventory at the 9-month follow-up.Conclusions: Assignment to IPT-MOMS was associated with reduced levels of maternal symptoms and improved functioning at the 3- and 9-month follow-ups compared to treatment as usual. Maternal improvement preceded improvement in offspring, suggesting that maternal changes may mediate child outcomes.",Swartz HA,10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.07081339,American Journal of Psychiatry,brief interpersonal psychotherapy for depressed mothers whose children are receiving psychiatric treatment.,Sep2008

334,"OBJECTIVE: Most depression treatment guidelines emphasize treatment with antidepressant medication and recommend that benzodiazepine use be minimized, particularly among elderly patients. However, little is known about patterns of benzodiazepine use in specialty mental health settings. The authors examined benzodiazepine use among a large sample of depressed patients treated in U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mental health settings. METHOD: The VA National Registry for Depression was used to identify patients treated for depression in specialty mental health settings in 129 VA facilities during the first 3 months of fiscal year 2001 (October 1 to December 31, 2000) (N=128,029). The VA pharmacy database was used to identify outpatients who filled a prescription for benzodiazepines. The authors report on the prevalence and patterns of outpatient benzodiazepine use during the study year (fiscal year 2001) and evaluate patient demographic and clinical factors associated with use. RESULTS: During the study year, 36% of the depressed patients filled a benzodiazepine prescription and 89% filled an antidepressant prescription. Most users (78%) received > or = 90 days supply of benzodiazepines, and 61% received > or = 180 days supply. Older patients, whites, Hispanics, and patients with comorbid anxiety disorders were more likely to use benzodiazepines. Older patients were also more likely to receive > or = 90 days supply of benzodiazepines, compared with younger patients, but were treated with lower doses. Benzodiazepine use varied significantly with region of the country and facility. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed patients treated in mental health settings commonly receive long-term treatment with benzodiazepines in combination with antidepressants, a pattern of use that is inconsistent with guideline recommendations. Elderly patients are particularly likely to receive benzodiazepines. Further research on the effectiveness of this widespread practice is needed.",Valenstein M,NLM15056511,American Journal of Psychiatry,benzodiazepine use among depressed patients treated in mental health settings.,Apr2004

Psychiatrists (N=2,800) were randomly selected from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile, and 1,188 of the 2,615 (45%) with deliverable addresses responded. Of those, 93% (N=1,099) reported currently treating psychiatric patients, forming the sample for this study.Results: Thirty percent or more of psychiatrists reported being unable to provide or find a source for each of the following services in the past 30 days: psychotherapy, housing, supported employment, case management or assertive community treatment, and substance use treatment. Approximately 20% reported being unable to provide or find a source for inpatient treatment, psychosocial rehabilitation, general medical care, pharmacologic treatment, and child and adolescent treatment. Approximately half (52%) of psychiatrists reported not having enough time during patient visits, affecting 28% of patients. More than one-third (37%) reported being unable to provide enough visits to meet patients clinical needs, affecting 24% of patients.Conclusions: Psychiatrists reported constrained availability of a range of mental health, substance use, and general medical services.

169,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the patterns of insomnia and sleep-related movement from ages 4.5 to 9 years, their concurrent associations with mental health symptoms in childhood, and the longitudinal associations of sleep-problem persistence with mental health symptoms at ages 9 and 18 years. DESIGN: A 14-year prospective follow-up study. Assessments included maternal report on the Childrens Sleep Habits Questionnaire at ages 4.5 and 9, and child mental health symptoms via maternal report at age 4.5, multi-informant (child, teacher, mother) report at age 9, and adolescent report at age 18. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 396 children (51% female). INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep problems were more common at age 4.5 than 9; symptoms of insomnia and abnormal sleep movement both had persistence rates of 9-10%. At age 4.5, insomnia was associated with hostile-aggressive and hyperactive-distractible behavior, but there were no significant associations for sleep movement. At age 9, both insomnia and sleep movement were associated with symptoms of depression, externalizing, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Insomnia persistence was associated with symptoms of depression, externalizing, and ADHD at age 9 and anxiety and externalizing at age 18; sleep- movement persistence was associated with externalizing and ADHD at age 9, and ADHD at age 18. The age 18 persistence effects for insomnia and anxiety and for sleep movement and ADHD were significant when controlling for earlier mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood insomnia and sleep movement are common and associated with mental health symptoms.

97,"Objective: Level of functioning is positively associated with subjective quality of life for people with severe mental illness, but a detailed relationship between functioning and satisfaction with various life domains is largely unknown, and this gap prompted this study.Methods: Demographic and clinical data were obtained from 149 patients engaged with 12 assertive community treatment teams in Norway. Multivariate regression analyses were used to explore associations between subjective quality of life and patient characteristics.Results: Analyses confirmed positive associations between quality of life and age, functioning, and weekly contact with family and friends and a negative association with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Positive associations between several areas of practical and social functioning and satisfaction with related life domains also were found.Conclusions: Although a causal direction of the associations between functioning and life satisfaction has not been determined in this study, the positive findings might indicate that programs aiming to improve functioning could affect patients quality of life.","Clausen, Hanne",10.1176/appi.ps.201400376,Psychiatric Services,associations between quality of life and functioning in an assertive community treatment population.,Nov2015

241,"Objective: To compare the health costs of groups with and without psychiatric diagnoses (PDs) using 9 years of physician billing data.Methods: A dataset containing registration data for all patients receiving public mental health service was constructed and subsequently matched, on age and sex, in a final patient to comparison patient ratio of 1:8, with health care users who did not receive treatment in the mental health system. Three groups emerged: a patient PD group-patients with psychiatric disorders treated in public mental health care (n = 76 677); a comparison patient PD group-comparison patients with PDs treated in physicians only (n = 277 627); and a patient- comparison patient non-PD group-patients (treated in specialized publicly funded care or by their physician) without PDs (n = 329 177). Examining over 42 million billing records for all of these patients, we compared the average number of visits and the average health only (nonpsychiatric) billing cost per each patient during the 9-year study period across the groups.Results: Among all health care users in the data, the health costs (Total Costs - Mental Health Costs) were greater on average for the patients with PD group ($3437) and the comparison patient PD group ($3265), compared with patient-comparison patient non-PD group ($1345). Forty-six percent of the comparison sample had a PD.Conclusions: Having a mental health problem is related to greater health-related expenditures.

192,"OBJECTIVE Disruptive behavior leading to seclusion or restraint increases with patients in a high-acuity stage of mental illness who have histories of aggressive behavior. The study examined whether greater nursing staff empathy skills and motivation reduced use of seclusion and restraint and whether empathy training can further this effect. METHODS In 1,098 nursing shifts in 2 six-month periods one year apart, hierarchical analyses examined the effects of nursing shift and patient characteristics, the effect for each shift of nurses skill and motivation to use empathy, and whether empathy training reduced use of seclusion and restraint. RESULTS With controls for shift, patient, and other staffing variables, analyses showed that the presence of more nursing staff with above-average empathy ratings was strongly associated with reduced use of seclusion and restraint but empathy training showed no further benefit. CONCLUSIONS Recruiting and retaining empathic nursing staff may be the best way to reduce the use of seclusion and restraint.","Yang, Chin-Po Paul",10.1176/appi.ps.201200531,Psychiatric Services,association of empathy of nursing staff with reduction of seclusion and restraint in psychiatric inpatient care.,Feb2014

195,"OBJECTIVE: The Monthly Treatment and Progress Summary (MTPS) was developed to assess treatment techniques applied in clinical practice. This study examined the factor structure of the reported therapeutic practice elements on the MTPS and explored patterns in technique use based on client and therapist characteristics in a community mental health setting. METHODS: MTPS data from 278 lead therapists in Hawaiis local system of care were extracted from the online state mental health information management system. Therapists endorsements (yes-no) of each practice element were examined across 278 completed youth treatment episodes, and an exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted on the categorical data set. RESULTS: Three factors emerged from the analyses: behavior management (behavioral interventions), coping and self-control (self-change practices), and family interventions (family supports). Treatment teams with licensed therapists reported higher use of coping and self-control practice elements, whereas teams with unlicensed therapists and paraprofessionals reported greater use of behavior management practice elements. Lead therapists reported that teams treating younger clients and those with attentional disorders were more likely to use behavior management practice elements, and teams treating youths with more severe impairment at intake utilized more behavior management and family intervention practice elements. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the MTPS shows promise as a therapist report of practices. The finding that practice elements organized into theoretical patterns and were applied in expected ways suggests a thoughtful approach to usual care techniques. With the increased focus on health care reform and managed care, the MTPS can inform system monitoring, feedback, and improvement.

213,"Objective: Some literature suggests that compulsory community treatment orders (CTOs) are effective in reducing hospitalizations in a subgroup of psychiatric patients with histories of repeated hospitalization, allowing them to be treated in the community under less restrictive measures. However, studies have yielded contradictory findings, in part because of methodological differences. Our study examines the effectiveness of CTOs in reducing hospitalizations and increasing community tenure of such patients.Method: The sample included all psychiatric patients who had been given a CTO during a 9-year period at 2 of McGill Universitys hospitals. This is a naturalistic, observational, retrospective, before-and-after study where patients acted as their own control subjects. We examined variables, including the number, duration, and time to psychiatric admissions, comparing 4 time periods: early, pre-index, index (when the first CTO was in force), and post-index periods. The total study duration per subject encompasses the longest period of observation within existing studies in Canada.Results: Psychiatric patients with histories of frequent readmissions demonstrated a significant reduction in their number of hospitalizations as well as an increase in the median time to re-hospitalization, during the period when they were treated under a CTO. This effect of CTO was sustained even after the CTO had expired.Conclusions: Our study suggests that CTOs are effective in assisting psychiatric patients with histories of repeated hospitalizations to live and be treated in the community, diminishing the occurrence of frequent hospitalization.",Nakhost A,NLM22682573,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,assessing the outcome of compulsory treatment orders on management of psychiatric patients at 2 mcgill university-associated hospitals.,Jun2012

164,"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Washington States PACT, a recovery-oriented assertive community treatment (ACT) initiative, in reducing state psychiatric hospital use. METHODS A quasi-experimental design and administrative data were used to compare 450 PACT consumers and 450 propensity score-matched consumers receiving usual care. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) assessed the effects of PACT on use of state and local hospitals, emergency departments, crisis stabilization units, and arrests. The marginal effects of PACT were estimated for high users and low users of state hospitals at baseline. RESULTS No difference between PACT participants and control participants was observed in the probability of having any state hospital use. A reduction in state hospital use of between 32 and 33 days per person per year was observed (p.01). Reductions in state hospital costs were concentrated among PACT participants who had high state hospital use at baseline; cost reductions ranged from about $17,000 to $20,000 per person per year (p.01). State hospital cost reductions were partially offset by increases in use of local services, with small but significant (p.01) increases in local hospital use, use of emergency departments, and use of crisis stabilization services. CONCLUSIONS PACT had its greatest effects for consumers who were high utilizers of state psychiatric hospitals at baseline. Contrary to studies and commentaries from the United Kingdom, ACT remains a viable intervention in areas where state hospitals are overused. Whether blending traditional ACT with recovery-oriented practices also promotes consumer recovery requires further study.","Morrissey, Joseph P",10.1176/appi.ps.201200095,Psychiatric Services,assessing the effectiveness of recovery-oriented act in reducing state psychiatric hospital use.,Apr2013

109,"Background: Broadly disseminating and implementing evidence-based psychotherapies with high fidelity, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), has proved challenging for many health-care systems, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, especially in primary care settings such as small or remote clinics. A computer-based tool (based on the coordinated anxiety learning and management (CALM) program) was designed to support primary care-based mental health providers in delivering CBT. The objectives of this study are to modify the CALM tool to meet the needs of mental health clinicians in veterans affairs (VA) community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) and rural ""veterans"", use external facilitation to implement CBT and determine the effect of the CALM tool versus a manualized version of CALM to improve fidelity to the CBT treatment model, and conduct a needs assessment to understand how best to support future implementation of the CALM tool in routine care.Methods/design: Focus groups will inform the redesign of the CALM tool. Mental health providers at regional VA CBOCs; CBT experts; VA experts in implementation of evidence-based mental health practices; and veterans with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, ""with or without"" depression will be recruited. A hybrid type III design will be used to examine the effect of receiving CBT training plus either the CALM tool or a manual version of CALM on treatment fidelity. External facilitation will be used as the overarching strategy to implement both CBT delivery methods. Data will also be collected on symptoms of the targeted disorders. To help prepare for the future implementation of the CALM tool in VA CBOCs, we will perform an implementation need assessment with mental health providers participating in the clinical trial and their CBOC directors.Discussion: This project will help inform strategies for delivering CBT with high fidelity in VA CBOCs to veterans with anxiety disorders and PTSD with or without depression. If successful, results of this study could be used to inform a national rollout of the CALM tool in VA CBOCs including providing recommendations for optimizing the adoption and sustained use of the computerized CALM tool among mental health providers in this setting.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02488551.","Cucciare, Michael A.",10.1186/s13012-016-0432-4,Implementation Science,assessing fidelity of cognitive behavioral therapy in rural va clinics: design of a randomized implementation effectiveness (hybrid type iii) trial.,5/10/2016

171,"Objective: To present a framework for assessing childrens disaster reactions and mental health needs.Methods: We reviewed the relevant literature and clinical experience to identify information on assessment approaches in children and to construct an assessment framework based on disaster exposure.Results: Child disaster mental health assessment includes 2 components-screening and clinical evaluation-but these have not been fully explicated or distinguished in the literature. Screening can be used to assess large numbers of children across exposure groups. Clinical evaluation is appropriate for children who are directly exposed to a disaster, for those whose family members and (or) close associates are directly exposed, and for those who are identified through screening as being at risk for psychiatric disturbance. Clinical evaluation includes a full diagnostic assessment (posttraumatic stress disorder and other disorders) with the goals of identifying psychopathology, determining the need for clinical care, and guiding intervention planning and referral. Children with psychiatric conditions should be referred to treatment, while those with psychological distress but without psychiatric illness may benefit from psychosocial interventions.Conclusions: Screening is appropriate to identify children at risk for psychiatric disturbance who will need further evaluation to determine diagnosis. Screening should not be used to dictate treatment decisions. Children who screen positive for psychiatric risk should receive a full clinical evaluation. Children determined to be suffering from psychiatric disorders should receive, or be referred for, formal treatment. Children without psychiatric disorders may benefit from psychosocial interventions.","Pfefferbaum, Betty",NLM23461884,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,assessing childrens disaster reactions and mental health needs: screening and clinical evaluation.,Mar2013

274,"Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to identify influences on the current clinical practices of a broad range of mental health providers as well as influences on their adoption and sustained use of new practices.Methods: U.S. and Canadian psychotherapists (N=2,607) completed a Web-based survey in which they rated factors that influence their clinical practice, including their adoption and sustained use of new treatments.Results: Empirical evidence had little influence on the practice of mental health providers. Significant mentors, books, training in graduate school, and informal discussions with colleagues were the most highly endorsed influences on current practice. The greatest influences on psychotherapists willingness to learn a new treatment were its potential for integration with the therapy they were already providing and its endorsement by therapists they respected. Clinicians were more often willing to continue to use a new treatment when they were able to effectively and enjoyably conduct the therapy and when their clients liked the therapy and reported improvement.Conclusions: Implications for dissemination and sustained use of new psychotherapies by community psychotherapists are discussed. For example, evidence-based treatments may best be promoted through therapy courses and workshops, beginning with graduate studies; to ensure future use of new therapies, developers of training workshops should emphasize ways to integrate their approaches into clinicians existing practices.",Cook JM,10.1176/appi.ps.60.5.671,Psychiatric Services,apples dont fall far from the tree: influences on psychotherapists adoption and sustained use of new therapies.,May2009

Randomized controlled trials of CTOs are rare because of ethical and logistical concerns. This meta-analysis updates available evidence.Method: A systematic literature search was performed of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register, Science Citation Index, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase to November 2013. Inclusion criteria were studies comparing CTOs with standard care including those where control subjects received voluntary care, for most of the trial.Results: Three studies provided 749 subjects for the meta-analysis. Two compared compulsory treatment with entirely voluntary care, while the third had control subjects receiving voluntary treatment for the bulk of the time. Compared with control subjects, CTOs did not reduce readmissions (risk ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16) or bed days (mean difference MD -16.36; 95% CI -40.8 to 8.05) in the subsequent 12 months (n = 749). Moreover, there were no significant differences in psychiatric symptoms (standardized MD -0.03; 95% CI -0.25 to 0.19; n = 331) or the Global Assessment of Functioning (MD -1.36; 95% CI -4.07 to 1.35; n = 335). Only including the 2 studies that compared compulsory treatment with entirely voluntary care made no difference to the results.Conclusions: CTOs may not lead to significant differences in readmission, social functioning, or symptomatology, compared with standard care. Their use should be kept under review.","Kisely, Steve",NLM25565690,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled evidence for the effectiveness of community treatment orders.,Oct2014

Of 182 clients, 44 percent reported that they disliked nothing; 21 percent said that they disliked features that are considered specific to assertive community treatment, such as home visits, or that have been criticized in the literature, such as intrusiveness; 16 percent said that they were dissatisfied with underimplementation of elements thought to characterize assertive community treatment, such as frequency of visits; and 19 percent said that they were dissatisfied with general aspects of mental health service delivery, such as an inconvenient office location.

123,"OBJECTIVES?: To provide descriptive information on behavioral health (BH) productivity and billing practices within a pediatric primary care setting. METHODS?: This retrospective investigation reviewed 30 months of electronic medical records and financial data. RESULTS?: The percent of BH provider time spent in direct patient care (productivity) was 35.28% overall, with a slightly higher quarterly average (M? = ?36.42%; SD? =? 6.46%). In the 646.75?hr BH providers spent in the primary care setting, $52,050.00 was charged for BH services delivered ($80.48 hourly average). CONCLUSIONS?: BH productivity and billing within pediatric primary care were suboptimal and likely multifactorially derived. To promote integrated primary care sustainability, the authors recommend three future aims: improve BH productivity, demonstrate the value-added contributions of BH services within primary care, and advocate for BH-supporting health care reform.","Cederna-Meko, Crystal L.",10.1093/jpepsy/jsw063,Journal of Pediatric Psychology,an exploration of behavioral health productivity and billing practices within pediatric primary care.,Nov/Dec2016
144,"Objective: Many offenders treated for psychiatric disorders while incarcerated are paroled to counties where psychiatric care is limited, leading some correctional departments to offer psychiatric treatment via videoconferencing (""telepsychiatry""). However, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry for offenders with psychiatric disorders has not been rigorously evaluated.Methods: In this randomized field experiment, the authors compared the effectiveness of telepsychiatry and in-person psychiatric sessions (treatment as usual) among 71 parolees receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment over a six-month period. Satisfaction with treatment, therapeutic alliance, medication adherence, and psychological functioning were measured. Follow-up data were collected from 60 of the 71 (85%) patients (N=20, telepsychiatry; N=40, control condition).Results: Findings revealed high satisfaction with telepsychiatry overall and no significant group differences in medication adherence or psychological functioning. However, telepsychiatry patients reported lower levels of therapeutic alliance at follow-up.Conclusions: Telepsychiatry appeared to be an acceptable and effective approach for providing psychiatric care for this population.","Farabee, David",10.1176/appi.ps.201500025,Psychiatric Services,an experimental comparison of telepsychiatry and conventional psychiatry for parolees.,May2016

333,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether data needed to inform evidence-based practice can be found in leading mental health journals. METHODS: Research studies described in articles that were published in 12 leading mental health journals in 1999 were examined to determine whether they evaluated clinical interventions, used rigorous designs, were conducted in routine practice settings, and included well-defined diagnostic groups and heterogeneous samples. RESULTS: Twenty-seven percent (N=295) of the 1,076 articles that were reviewed described research that evaluated interventions. Of these 295 articles, 64 percent evaluated pharmacologic interventions and 33 percent evaluated psychosocial or psychotherapeutic interventions. Of the articles that evaluated interventions, 60 percent described randomized designs, but samples were modest; 25 percent of the studies reported 31 or fewer participants. Of the 295 articles, 84 percent described studies conducted in specialty mental health settings; very few (4 percent) described studies conducted in public mental health or managed care environments, which are common practice settings. Most samples were diagnostically well defined, but evidence of treatments for diagnoses other than schizophrenia and mood disorders was limited. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggested that data needed to inform and advance evidence-based practice does not have the prominent place it deserves in leading journals. Only a quarter of the research studies that were examined evaluated clinical interventions, and articles that described pharmacologic interventions were published twice as often as articles that described psychosocial or psychotherapeutic interventions. Rigorous research designs predominated, but sample sizes were modest.

206,"Mental health intervention research requires clear and accurate specification of treatment conditions in intervention studies. Measures are increasingly available for community-based interventions for persons with serious mental illnesses. Measures must go beyond structural features to assess critical processes in interventions. They must also balance effectiveness, or adequate coverage of active treatment elements, with efficiency, or the degree to which measures may be used cost-effectively. The context of their use is changing with the emergence of new frameworks for implementation research and quality improvement. To illustrate a range of approaches, this article describes four recently developed fidelity measures: Cognitive Therapy for Psychosis Adherence Scale, Strengths Model Fidelity Scale, Illness Management and Recovery Program Fidelity Scale, and Tool for Measurement of ACT. The fidelity measures assess interventions in a range of treatment contexts from dyads to teams. Each measure focuses assessment resources on critical elements. Each has demonstrated coverage of its target intervention and satisfactory psychometric properties and is related to outcomes. Measures have been used for training, quality improvement, or certification. They assess domains and have uses beyond their nominal position in implementation and quality frameworks. This review of recent fidelity measures indicates that process components in community-based interventions can be effectively assessed. Omission of elements assessing potentially critical active treatment components poses risk to both research and practice until there is evidence to demonstrate that they are nonessential. Further development of fidelity measurement theory and approaches should proceed in conjunction with development of theory and methods in implementation science.",Teague GB,10.1176/appi.ps.201100430,Psychiatric Services,advances in fidelity measurement for mental health services research: four measures.,Aug2012

121,"Purpose: Guidelines recommend screening patients for unhealthy behaviors and mental health concerns. Health risk assessments can systematically identify patient needs and trigger care. This study seeks to evaluate whether primary care practices can routinely implement such assessments into routine care.Methods: As part of a cluster-randomized pragmatic trial, 9 diverse primary care practices implemented My Own Health Report (MOHR)-an electronic or paper-based health behavior and mental health assessment and feedback system paired with counseling and goal setting. We observed how practices integrated MOHR into their workflows, what additional practice staff time it required, and what percentage of patients completed a MOHR assessment (Reach).Results: Most practices approached (60%) agreed to adopt MOHR. How they implemented MOHR depended on practice resources, informatics capacity, and patient characteristics. Three practices mailed patients invitations to complete MOHR on the Web, 1 called patients and completed MOHR over the telephone, 1 had patients complete MOHR on paper in the office, and 4 had staff help patients complete MOHR on the Web in the office. Overall, 3,591 patients were approached and 1,782 completed MOHR (Reach = 49.6%). Reach varied by implementation strategy with higher reach when MOHR was completed by staff than by patients (71.2% vs 30.2%, P <.001). No practices were able to sustain the complete MOHR assessment without adaptations after study completion. Fielding MOHR increased staff and clinician time an average of 28 minutes per visit.Conclusions: Primary care practices can implement health behavior and mental health assessments, but counseling patients effectively requires effort. Practices will need more support to implement and sustain assessments.","Krist, Alex H",10.1370/afm.1710,Annals of Family Medicine,"adoption, reach, implementation, and maintenance of a behavioral and mental health assessment in primary care.",Nov/Dec2014
93,"Background: This study examined how mental health clinic administrators decided whether or not to adopt evidence-based and other innovative practices by exploring their views of implementation barriers and facilitators and operation of these views in assessment of implementation costs and benefits.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 75 agency chief executive officers and program directors of 34 New York State-licensed mental health clinics serving children and adolescents.Results: Three interconnected themes relating to barriers and facilitators were identified, namely costs and benefits associated with adoption, capacity for adoption, and acceptability of new practices. The highest percentage of participants (86.7%) mentioned costs as a barrier, followed by limited capacity (55.9%) and lack of acceptability (52.9%). The highest percentage (82.3%) of participants identified available capacity as a facilitator, followed by acceptability (41.2%) and benefits or limited costs (24.0%). Assessment of costs and benefits exhibited several principles of behavioural economics, including loss aversion, temporal discounting use of heuristics, sensitivity to monetary incentives, decision fatigue, framing, and environmental influences.Conclusions: The results point to opportunities for using agency leader models to develop strategies to facilitate implementation of evidence-based and innovative practices for children and adolescents.","Palinkas, Lawrence A.",10.1186/s12961-017-0190-z,Health Research Policy & Systems,adoption of innovative and evidence-based practices for children and adolescents in state-supported mental health clinics: a qualitative study.,3/29/2017

Factors that could be associated with adequacy of care also were explored.Methods: A total of 333 patients from primary care who began pharmacological antidepressant treatment were followed up for six months. Treatment adequacy and associated factors were evaluated.Results: Between 27% and 32% of patients received adequate antidepressant treatment during the acute phase. Percentages of adequacy were between 21% and 25% when considering the acute phase and the first three months of the continuation phase. Psychiatric consultations were found to be associated with treatment adequacy.Conclusions: In state-funded Spanish primary care centers, antidepressant treatment adequacy was poor during both the acute phase and the first three months of the continuation phase. Primary care physicians prescribed suggested antidepressants, mostly as recommended (99%) and at adequate dosages. However, they did not perform the recommended number of follow-up sessions and treated patients with depressive disorders other than major depression as if they had a major depressive episode.

The interventions were conducted by psychologists and nurse practitioners working independently from the ACT team. RESULTS: Although most patients were judged eligible for each of the four interventions (range 65% to 89%), only 12 of the 74 patients (16%) successfully completed an intervention. Outcomes, such as use of inpatient care, for ACT Plus and standard ACT patients did not differ significantly.

219,"OBJECTIVE Nationwide studies contrasting service use of racial-ethnic groups provide an overview of disparities, but because of variation in populations and service systems, local studies are required to identify specific targets for remedial action. The authors report on the use of non-inpatient services regulated in New York State (NYS) and report use by the states larger cultural groups. METHODS Data from the NYS Patient Characteristics Survey were used to estimate annual treated prevalence and treatment intensity, defined as the average number of annual weeks in service for non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and non-Hispanic whites. The latter rates were obtained for specific types of treatment use, by persons age and diagnosis, for the state and for population density-defined regions. Statistical methods contrasted rates of whites with other groups. RESULTS A total of 578,496 individuals in these racial-ethnic groups were served in 2,500 programs, and 51% of those served were nonwhite. Treated prevalence rates of whites were lower than those of blacks and Hispanics and were substantially higher than prevalence rates for Asians. Statewide treatment intensity rates of all racial-ethnic and age groups were comparable except for lower use among Asians 65. Key findings from granular analyses were lower treatment intensity rates for black youths with disruptive disorders, Hispanic adults with anxiety disorders, and Asians 65 with depression compared with white counterparts. In upstate metropolitan areas, black youths and Hispanic adults received services in fewer weeks than whites, and in the New York City metropolitan area, whites 65 had higher treatment intensity rates than contrast groups. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest a need for assistance to black families in negotiating the multiple systems used by their children, clinical training focusing on cultural symptom presentation, screening of Asians in community settings, and mandated cultural competency assessments for all programs.","Siegel, Carole E",10.1176/appi.ps.201200098,Psychiatric Services,access to and use of non-inpatient services in new york state among racial-ethnic groups.,Feb2013

81,"Background: Severe mental illness (SMI) is common, chronic and difficult to treat. Sleep and circadian dysfunctions are prominent correlates of SMI, yet have been minimally studied in ways that reflect the complexity of the sleep problems experienced. Prior treatment studies have been disorder-focused-they have treated a specific sleep problem in a specific diagnostic group. However, real life sleep and circadianproblems are not so neatly categorized, particularly in SMI where features of insomnia overlap with hypersomnia, delayed sleep phase and irregular sleep-wake schedules. Accordingly, the aim of this studyprotocol is to test the hypothesis that a Transdiagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C) will improve functional impairment, disorder-focused symptoms and sleep and circadian functioning. Participants across DSM diagnoses and across common sleep and circadian problems are eligible. The elements of TranS-C are efficacious across SMI in research settings with research-based providers. The next step is to test TranS-C in a community setting. Accordingly, this study is being conducted within Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBHCS), the Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) for Alameda County.Methods/design: 120 adults diagnosed with SMI and sleep and circadian dysfunction within ACBHCS will be randomly allocated to TranS-C (n = 60) or 6-months of Usual Care followed by Delayed Treatment with TranS-C (UC-DT; n = 60). TranS-C is modularized and delivered across eight to twelve 50-minute, weekly, individual sessions. All participants will be assessed before and immediately following treatment and again 6 months later. Primary analysis will examine whether TranS-C significantly improves functional impairment, disorder-specific symptoms and sleep and circadian functioning, relative to UC-DT. Exploratory analysis will examine whether improvements in sleep and circadian functioning predict reduction in functional impairment and disorder-specific symptoms, and whether the intervention effects are mediated by improved sleep and circadian functioning and moderated by previously reported risk factors (demographics, symptom severity, medications, psychiatric and medical comorbidity).Discussion: This trial tests an important and understudied mechanism-dysregulated sleep and circadian rhythms-in SMI, a novel transdiagnostic treatment approach, in a community setting so as to contribute to the goal of bridging the gap between research and practice.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02469233 .

156,"Background: Experimenters allegiance (EA) refers to a personal confidence of the superiority of a specific psychotherapy treatment. This factor has been linked with larger treatment effects in favor of the preferred treatment. However, various studies have displayed contradictory results between EA and the pattern of treatment effects. Aims: Using a systematic approach followed by meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the impact of an allegiance effect on the results of psychotherapeutic studies. Method: We considered the meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of different types of psychotherapies in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Eligible articles included meta-analyses of RCTs with at least one study showing evidence of EA (i.e., allegiant study). Effect sizes in allegiant RCTs were compared with non-allegiant using random and fixed models and a summary relative odds ratio (ROR) were calculated. Heterogeneity was quantified with the I2 metric. Results: A total of 30 meta-analyses including 240 RCTs were analyzed. The summary ROR was 1.31 (95 % confidence interval (CI: 1.03-1.66) P = 0.30, I2 = 53 % indicating larger effects when allegiance exists. The impact of allegiance did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) when we compared psychiatric versus medical outcomes. Allegiance effect was significant for all forms of psychotherapy except for cognitive behavioral therapy. Moreover, the impact of allegiance was significant only when the treatment integrity of delivered psychotherapy was not assessed. Allegiance effect was even stronger where the experimenter was also both the developer of the preferred treatment and supervised or trained the therapists. No significant differences were found between allegiant and non-allegiant studies in terms of overall quality of studies. Conclusions: Experimenters allegiance influences the effect sizes of psychotherapy RCTs and can be considered non-financial conflict of interest introducing a form of optimism bias, especially since blinding is problematic in this kind of research. A clear reporting of EA in every single study should be given an opportunity to investigators of minimizing its overestimation effects.","Dragioti, Elena",10.1186/s12991-015-0063-1,Annals of General Psychiatry,a systematic appraisal of allegiance effect in randomized controlled trials of psychotherapy.,9/15/2015

Our study aims to demonstrate the feasibility and face validity of routinely measuring the mortality gap in the Canadian context at the provincial and regional levels using the methods and data available to the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS) of the Public Health Agency of Canada. Methods: We used longitudinal data from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System, which also provides aggregated data to the CCDSS. This includes data from the health insurance registry physician claims and the hospital discharge abstract for all mental disorder diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases ICD-9 290-319 or ICD-10 F00-F99). Patients were defined as having had received a mental disorder diagnosis at least once during the year. Life expectancy was measured using Chiangs method for abridged life tables, complemented by the Hsieh method for adjustment of the last age interval. Results: We found a lower life expectancy among psychiatric patients of 8 years for men and 5 years for women. For patients with schizophrenia, life expectancy was lowered by 12 years for men and 8 years for women. Cardiovascular disease and cancer were the most common causes of premature death. Findings were consistent across time and regions of the province. Lower estimates of the mortality gap, compared with literature, could be explained by the inclusion of primary care patients and methods. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using administrative data to measure the impact of current and future mental health plans in Canada provided the techniques can be replicated in other Canadian provinces.","Lesage, Alain",10.1177/070674371506001208,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,a surveillance system to monitor excess mortality of people with mental illness in canada.,Dec2015

154,"The Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project represents an integration of research methodology into a community-based outpatient practice affiliated with an academic medical centre. The MIDAS project is the largest clinical epidemiological study using semi-structured interviews to assess a wide range of psychiatric disorders in a general clinical outpatient practice. In an early report from the MIDAS project, we found that across diagnostic categories clinicians using unstandardized, unstructured clinical interviews underrecognized diagnostic comorbidity, compared with the results of semi-structured interviews. Moreover, we found that the patients often wanted treatment for symptoms of disorders that were diagnosed as comorbid, rather than principal, conditions. This highlighted the importance, from the patients perspective, of conducting thorough diagnostic interviews to diagnose disorders that are not related to the patients chief complaint because patients often desire treatment for these additional diagnoses. While several of the initial papers from the MIDAS project identified problems with the detection of comorbid disorders in clinical practice, regarding the diagnosis of bipolar disorder we observed the emergence of an opposite phenomenon-clinician overdiagnosis. The results from the MIDAS project, along with other studies of diagnosis in routine clinical practice, have brought to the forefront the problem with diagnosis in routine clinical practice. An important question is what do these findings suggest about the community standard of care in making psychiatric diagnoses, and whether and how the standard of care should be changed? The implications are discussed.","Zimmerman, Mark",10.1177/0706743715625935,Canadian Journal of Psychiatry,a review of 20 years of research on overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis in the rhode island methods to improve diagnostic assessment and services (midas) project.,Feb2016

266,"Objective: Poor quality of healthcare contributes to impaired health and excess mortality in individuals with severe mental disorders. The authors tested a population-based medical care management intervention designed to improve primary medical care in community mental health settings.Method: A total of 407 subjects with severe mental illness at an urban community mental health center were randomly assigned to either the medical care management intervention or usual care. For individuals in the intervention group, care managers provided communication and advocacy with medical providers, health education, and support in overcoming system-level fragmentation and barriers to primary medical care.Results: At a 12-month follow-up evaluation, the intervention group received an average of 58.7% of recommended preventive services compared with a rate of 21.8% in the usual care group. They also received a significantly higher proportion of evidence-based services for cardiometabolic conditions (34.9% versus 27.7%) and were more likely to have a primary care provider (71.2% versus 51.9%). The intervention group showed significant improvement on the SF-36 mental component summary (8.0% versus a 1.1% decline in the usual care group) and a nonsignificant improvement on the SF-36 physical component summary. Among subjects with available laboratory data, scores on the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Index were significantly better in the intervention group (6.9%) than the usual care group (9.8%).Conclusions: Medical care management was associated with significant improvements in the quality and outcomes of primary care.

260,"Objective: Programs that offer alternatives to hospital-based acute psychiatric care have reported promising results of lower costs, equivalent or superior outcomes, and greater patient satisfaction. This study supplements previous research that compared the outcomes, satisfaction, and cost of hospital-based care and one such alternative program, short-term acute residential treatment (START), with an analysis of patient and staff perceptions of the treatment environments.Methods: Patients who participated were all veterans and were randomly assigned to receive treatment in a hospital psychiatric unit (N=45) or in START (N=48). Both groups completed the Ward Atmosphere Scale (WAS), a standardized measure of treatment environment, at the time of discharge. During the study, staff members from both types of programs also completed the WAS (15 hospital staff and 75 START staff).Results: Both patients and staff rated the START environment more favorably than the hospital environment on five of ten WAS subscales. No differences were found in congruence between staff and participants scores at START or the hospital. WAS profiles for patients and staff from the hospital closely matched published national norms for hospitals, whereas WAS profiles for patients and staff from START more closely resembled treatment environments recommended for the most disturbed patients (lower levels of anger and aggression and higher levels of support, problem orientation, and order and organization).Conclusions: The more favorable ratings of the treatment environment at START in this study are consistent with previously published findings demonstrating the viability of the START model as an alternative to hospital-based acute psychiatric care.",Hawthorne WB,10.1176/ps.2009.60.9.1239,Psychiatric Services,a randomized study comparing the treatment environment in alternative and hospital-based acute psychiatric care.,Sep2009

336,"OBJECTIVE: The delivery of appropriate treatment to persons who have mental and substance use disorders is of increasing concern to clinicians, administrators, and policy makers. This study sought to describe use of appropriate mental health and comprehensive substance abuse care among adults in the United States with probable co-occurring disorders. METHODS: Data from the Healthcare for Communities survey, which is based on a national household sample studied in 1997 and 1998, were used to identify individuals who had probable co-occurring mental and substance use disorders. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of these individuals and their use of services were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with receipt of mental health and substance abuse treatment and with receipt of appropriate treatment. RESULTS: Estimates for the U.S. adult population based on the weighted survey data indicated that 3 percent of the population had co-occurring disorders. Seventy-two percent did not receive any specialty mental health or substance abuse treatment in the previous 12 months; only 8 percent received both specialty mental health care and specialty substance abuse treatment. Only 23 percent received appropriate mental health care, and 9 percent received supplemental substance abuse treatment. Perceived need for treatment was strongly associated with receipt of any mental health care and with receipt of appropriate care. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of effective treatments, most individuals who had co-occurring mental health and substance use problems were not receiving effective treatment. Efforts to improve the care provided to persons who have co-occurring disorders should focus on strategies that increase the delivery of effective treatment.",Watkins KE,NLM11474052,Psychiatric Services,a national survey of care for persons with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders.,Aug2001

137,"OBJECTIVES This multisite study aimed to answer the following research questions about women in urban and rural jails. First, what is the current and lifetime prevalence of serious mental illness (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and psychotic spectrum disorders) of women in jail? Second, what level of impairment is associated with their serious mental illness? Third, what is the proportion of incarcerated women with serious mental illness who also have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a substance use disorder, or both? METHODS Participants were 491 women randomly sampled in jails in Colorado, Idaho, South Carolina, and the metropolitan area of Washington, D.C. Structured interviews assessed lifetime and 12-month prevalence of disorders and level of impairment. RESULTS Forty-three percent of participants met lifetime criteria for a serious mental illness, and 32% met 12-month criteria; among the latter, 45% endorsed severe functional impairment. Fifty-three percent met criteria for ever having PTSD. Almost one in three (29%) met criteria for a serious mental illness and PTSD, 38% for a serious mental illness and a co-occurring substance use disorder, and about one in four (26%) for all three in their lifetime. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of serious mental illness and its co-occurrence with substance use disorders and PTSD in this multisite sample suggest the critical need for comprehensive assessment of mental health at the point of womens entry into the criminal justice system and the necessity for more programs that offer alternatives to incarceration and that can address the complexity of female offenders treatment needs.","Lynch, Shannon M",10.1176/appi.ps.201300172,Psychiatric Services,"a multisite study of the prevalence of serious mental illness, ptsd, and substance use disorders of women in jail.",May2014

The article presents two-year findings from a multisite trial on the effectiveness of Housing First with ACT.Methods: The study design was a randomized controlled trial conducted in five Canadian cities. A sample of 950 participants with serious mental illness who were absolutely homeless or precariously housed were randomly assigned to receive either Housing First with ACT (N=469) or treatment as usual (N=481).Results: Housing First participants spent more time in stable housing than participants in treatment as usual (71% versus 29%, adjusted absolute difference AAD=42%, p<.01). Compared with treatment-as-usual participants, Housing First participants who entered housing did so more quickly (73 versus 220 days, AAD=146.4, p<.001), had longer housing tenures at the study end-point (281 versus 115 days, AAD=161.8, p<.01), and rated the quality of their housing more positively (adjusted standardized mean difference ASMD=.17, p<.01). Housing First participants reported higher quality of life (ASMD=.15, p<.01) and were assessed as having better community functioning (ASMD=.18, p<.01) over the two-year period. Housing First participants showed significantly greater gains in community functioning and quality of life in the first year; however, differences between the two groups were attenuated by the end of the second year.Conclusions: Housing First with ACT is an effective approach in various contexts for assisting individuals with serious mental illness to rapidly exit homelessness.","Aubry, Tim",10.1176/appi.ps.201400587,Psychiatric Services,a multiple-city rct of housing first with assertive community treatment for homeless canadians with serious mental illness.,3/1/2016

208,"Objective: Computer-assisted therapies offer a novel, cost-effective strategy for providing evidence-based therapies to a broad range of individuals with psychiatric disorders. However, the extent to which the growing body of randomized trials evaluating computer-assisted therapies meets current standards of methodological rigor for evidence-based interventions is not clear.Method: A methodological analysis of randomized clinical trials of computer-assisted therapies for adult psychiatric disorders, published between January 1990 and January 2010, was conducted. Seventy-five studies that examined computer-assisted therapies for a range of axis I disorders were evaluated using a 14-item methodological quality index.Results: Results indicated marked heterogeneity in study quality. No study met all 14 basic quality standards, and three met 13 criteria. Consistent weaknesses were noted in evaluation of treatment exposure and adherence, rates of follow-up assessment, and conformity to intention-to-treat principles. Studies utilizing weaker comparison conditions (e.g., wait-list controls) had poorer methodological quality scores and were more likely to report effects favoring the computer-assisted condition.Conclusions: While several well-conducted studies have indicated promising results for computer-assisted therapies, this emerging field has not yet achieved a level of methodological quality equivalent to those required for other evidence-based behavioral therapies or pharmacotherapies. Adoption of more consistent standards for methodological quality in this field, with greater attention to potential adverse events, is needed before computer-assisted therapies are widely disseminated or marketed as evidence based.",Kiluk BD,10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.10101443,American Journal of Psychiatry,a methodological analysis of randomized clinical trials of computer-assisted therapies for psychiatric disorders: toward improved standards for an emerging field.,Aug2011

367,"Background: Several studies suggest that the number of risk factors rather than their nature is key to mental health disorders in childhood.Method and Design: The objective of this multicentre randomized controlled parallel trial (PROBE methodology) is to assess the impact in a multi-risk French urban sample of a home-visiting program targeting child mental health and its major determinants. This paper describes the protocol of this study. In the study, pregnant women were eligible if they were: living in the intervention area; able to speak French, less than 26?years old; having their first child; less than 27?weeks of amenorrhea; and if at least one of the following criteria were true: less than twelve years of education, intending to bring up their child without the presence of the childs father, and 3) low income. Participants were randomized into either the intervention or the control group. All had access to usual care in mother-child centres and community mental health services free of charge in every neighbourhood. Psychologists conducted all home visits, which were planned on a weekly basis from the 7th month of pregnancy and progressively decreasing in frequency until the childs second birthday. Principle outcome measures included child mental health at 24?months and two major mediating variables for infant mental health: postnatal maternal depression and the quality of the caring environment. A total of 440 families were recruited, of which a subsample of 120 families received specific attachment and caregiver behaviour assessment. Assessment was conducted by an independent assessment team during home visits and, for the attachment study, in a specifically created Attachment Assessment laboratory.Discussion: The CAPEDP study is the first large-scale randomised, controlled infant mental health promotion programme to take place in France. A major specificity of the program was that all home visits were conducted by specifically trained, supervised psychologists rather than nurses. Significant challenges included designing a mental health promotion programme targeting vulnerable families within one of the most generous but little assessed health and social care systems in the Western World.Trial Registration: Current Clinical trial number is NCT00392847.","Tubach, Florence",10.1186/1471-2458-12-648,BMC Public Health,a home-visiting intervention targeting determinants of infant mental health: the study protocol for the capedp randomized controlled trial in france.,2012

352,"Objective: The activities of mental health practitioners are poorly understood and described because of a lack of generally accepted and understandable categories. Greater precision is needed for accountability, planning, and evaluation. The objective of this study was to identify a valid and reliable set of categories to describe the clinical work practices of intensive case managers in the United Kingdom. Methods: Eight intensive case managers participated in a Delphi process to produce a set of categories that described their clinical work practices. They each completed three questionnaires and participated in a final group discussion. Results: The initial open questionnaire generated 38 potential categories after exact duplicates were removed. In round 2, the intensive case managers each rated the 38 categories from 1 to 5 (essential to unimportant). A high degree of consensus on the relative importance of the 38 suggested practice categories was rapidly achieved. In round 3, they re-rated the categories in the light of group medians and their own round 2 ratings. In a structured face-to-face discussion group, the intensive case managers then reduced the 38 potential categories to ten comprehensive and mutually exclusive categories that were judged to adequately and accurately reflect work practices. They were housing, finance, daily living skills, criminal justice system, occupation and leisure, engagement, physical health, caregivers and significant others, specific mental health intervention or assessment, and medication. Conclusions: Delphi methods were effective and relatively straightforward in producing an agreed-on set of categories with which to record clinical activity and inform care planning.",Fiander M,NLM10783186,Psychiatric Services,a delphi approach to describing service models of community mental health practice.,May2000

196,"Background: Psychological health is related to the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and is an essential component of self-efficacy and enjoying a healthy lifestyle. Need assessment and plans to improve the psychological health of these women provides significantly valuable information to design an advantageous intervention program to reach that goal. Therefore, this study will conduct to improve the psychological health for women with PCOS through a designed comprehensive care. Methods: This is an exploratory mixed method study using consecutive qualitative-quantitative methods, including three consecutive phases. In the first phase, a qualitative study will be conducted to assess their needs and will design a care protocol for improving mental health of women with PCOS. Participants in this phase will select by purposive sampling method and data will collect using semi-structured interviews by taking notes at same time. Data will analyze using conventional content analysis method. At second phase, according the information obtained from previous phase and a literature review a comprehensive program to mental health care will be proposed. Then multidisciplinary team will review and finalize it according to priorities. The third phase will follow a quantitative approach using quasi-experimental study with two groups to measure the effectiveness of this program on the women’s psychological health. Discussion: Designing a program based on a qualitative study and a review article and updated evidences can lead to improving of these women’s psychological health and quality of life. Consequently, we expect to show that mental health program provided by a multidisciplinary team improves reproductive outcomes while at the same time being cost-effective in women with PCOS.","ZareMobini, Fatemeh",10.1186/s12978-018-0488-5,Reproductive Health,a comprehensive mental health care program for women with polycystic ovary syndrome: protocol for a mixed methods study.,3/13/2018
200,"Objective: Monitoring fidelity of assertive community treatment (ACT) teams is costly. This study investigated the reliability and validity of a less burdensome approach: self-reported assessment.Methods: Phone-administered and self-reported assessments were compared for 16 ACT teams. Team leaders completed a self-report protocol providing information sufficient to score the Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale (DACTS). Two raters scored the DACTS using only self-reported information. Two additional raters conducted phone interviews with team leaders, verifying the self-reported data, and independently scored the DACTS.Results: DACTS total scores obtained via self-reported assessments were reliable and valid compared with phone-administered assessment on the basis of interrater consistency (intraclass correlation) and consensus (mean rating differences). Phone-administered assessments agreed with self-reported assessments within .25 scale points (out of 5 points) for 15 of 16 teams.Conclusions: A self-report approach could address concerns regarding costs of monitoring as part of a stepped approach to quality assurance.","McGrew, John H",10.1176/appi.ps.001252012,Psychiatric Services,a comparison of self-reported and phone-administered methods of act fidelity assessment: a pilot study in indiana.,Mar2013

Twenty experts on assertive community treatment and 22 experts on intensive case management rated the importance of 40 elements common to each treatment approach. The assertive community treatment experts gave higher importance ratings than the intensive case management experts to 37 of the 40 items; for 21 of these items, the ratings were significantly higher. Differences in importance ratings were greatest for organizational and structural elements and smallest for treatment goals.

271,"Objective: This article reviews the evidence for the effectiveness of community-based services for rural areas, specifically assertive community treatment and intensive case management. Service delivery to persons with severe mental illness in rural areas is challenged by low population densities, limited services, and shortages of professionals.Methods: A comprehensive literature search identified six studies of rural assertive community treatment, only two of which were controlled studies, and four rural intensive case management studies, only one of which was a controlled study. Assertive community treatment would seem ideally suited to areas lacking services because of its self-contained multidisciplinary treatment team approach. However, rural programs have been forced to make several adaptations to the assertive community treatment model, including smaller teams, less comprehensive staff, and less intensive services. There is no published evidence that these adaptations are able to produce the same results as full-fidelity teams. Some believe that intensive case management may be an alternative to assertive community treatment in rural settings because intensive case management emphasizes individual caseloads, fewer staff, less intensive contacts, and brokered services.Conclusions: The evidence suggests that intensive case management programs are effective only in community settings where there is an ample supply of treatment and support services. To build the evidence base for the effectiveness of these models, much more attention needs to be focused on evaluating the current wave of assertive community treatment and intensive case management dissemination in rural areas.",Meyer PS,NLM17215422,Psychiatric Services,a comparison of assertive community treatment and intensive case management for patients in rural areas.,Jan2007
